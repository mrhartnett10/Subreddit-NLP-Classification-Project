3,intj,"I'll try to keep this short, I'm a 20 year old INTJ from Asia pursuing a degree in Business Administration  &amp; IT. I'm about to graduate in the coming months, but the thing is I've never been more lost.To begin with, I didn't exactly get to grow up in a safe environment.  My parents ESTJ Dad (pretend do gooder Bureaucrat) &amp; ESFJ mom (train wreck with a Victim Complex) , were always at each each other throats, they never get along. I think they're the kind of people that's never supposed to have children in the first place. But they decided to somehow fix their cluster fuck of a marriage, by having 3 kids, cause apparently its the only thing that gave my mom hope to keep going on with her life, "" wise fucking choice "" to add more children into this mess. With a situation like this,  I believe I never really received the care/guidance I required when I was a child. For all my childhood and teenage years, I was always confused lost and lonely. I to this date don't really have anybody i feel connected with.Around the age of 17, I managed to move to a different city to pursue further education &amp; opted for Businesses Administration  &amp; IT. For once, I felt free. I didn't have to always watch out for signs of aggression all the time. I learned how to socialize and for once, atleast  briefly was content with my life. But it didn't  last long.In the wake of the pandemic, I had to go back to live with my family again &amp; been stuck here ever since. I miss being free to be myself,  the friendships I made are  fading away with time and I don't blame anyone for it, people change over time. I gave up all social media and I'm also in Day 2 of getting clean, from months of Marijuana habitual use.  I've been trying to study a bit &amp; set a routine,  after going months without sticking to a sleep schedule. The reason why I wrote all this is, is because I wanted to paint a picture of what situation I'm in. I've never felt this lonely  in a while &amp; I don't know what to do. I keep reminding myself to try &amp; move past it,  hoping this'll someday stop bothering me. Hopefully,  soon I'll get out of this mess.",I just need someone to hear me out

8,intj,"I first found out about the MBTI in the supplement to a book that was actually about the Enneagram, and I notice that some people here share their Enneagram types in flair or in comments/posts. I feel my MB type is pretty clear and beyond a little bit of waffle between J and P at the beginning (clarified by aging and by function order) it's never really been in doubt, but I have always had the *hardest* time deciding where I fall in the Enneagram. Surprisingly to me, a lot of people feel that the Enneagram is more fundamental and more easy to determine a type while they fall ""in the middle"" on MB scales. I can understand being relatively in-the-middle, but to me the Enneagram just seems like kind of a random sorting of different motivations and features.So I guess I'm interested in other people's thoughts on the Enneagram - does it intuitively make sense to you? do you have to look at it a certain way to make sense of it? do you think it may just not apply to some people? - and give a little bit of history about my type. At first I figured I was a 5. I could see how wings 4 and 6, and arrows 7 and 8 kind of made sense. As looked deeper though I started doubting it - I think perhaps the arrows were reversed of what they should be? and wondered if I might actually be an 8 or a 1, it definitely didn't make sense that 5 had no connection to 1. I think for a while I thought I might be a 6, and the last time I really looked into it I decided probably a 9 fit the best.Basically I feel like I have some relatedness to almost all the types, except definitely not 2. I don't think 7, 3, or 4 could be my primary type but might be a wing or an arrow. And then there are 5 remaining types (more than half) that could legitimately be my type but I can't really find a combination of wings and arrows that makes more sense than the others. I still feel that probably most likely is 5 or 9, but 6, 8, and 1 are still significant second choices. I kind of just gave up on the whole system since MBTI is so much more fitting and IMO straightforward but it still kind of *bothers* me so yeah, I'm just looking for input or commentary I guess.",INTJs and enneagram

13,intj,"So I'm an INFJ and my dad is an INTJ. I have very often noticed that both of us have a very similar mentality and a very similar way of approaching information and processing it. However the conclusions we draw from that information are very different. My dad has a very stick at the back of the mule and carrot at its front type of parenting style. He sees everything in this very logical way where one thing inevitably leads to another and he rarely ever doubts his conclusions and hence tends to take strong action on them. Also, he lays very little stress on like individual opinions of people surrounding him on a action rather he would ask some people who he by some metric has deemed that their opinion is worth more than mine or sometimes even his own. He believes very strongly in his conclusions and doesn't doubt them even if they are proven wrong. Instead he would rather blame the people in the scenario for not behaving optimally as is required. He also does not view friendships as something someone should make because they resonate with the other person but believes you should make friends with people who can serve a specific purpose or who are better than you in studies specifically. He rarely ever takes feelings into consideration and things which would appear as natural to other people appear as weaknesses to him. He is very highly principled though and that is one thing I will never stop admiring about him. I know he has my best interest in mind always but sometimes I feel he has a very single and narrow minded way of looking at the world which often brings us into conflict.

16,intj," Natalism- Natalism is a belief that promotes the reproduction of human life. The term comes from the Latin adjective for ""birth"", nātālis. Natalism promotes child-bearing and parenthood as desirable for social reasons and to ensure the continuance of humanity. Antinatialism- Antinatalism, or anti-natalism, is a philosophical position and social movement that assigns a negative value to birth. Antinatalists argue that humans should abstain from procreation because it is morally wrong. In scholarly and in literary writings, various ethical foundations have been presented for antinatalism.

17,intj,"I've just had maybe the hugest fight of all my life with family members. Some neighbors were commenting on calling police, luckily they did not.I am tired of my family.I don't feel like they love me so I am unable to love them back.My brother used to bully me when I was young ( he was 13 years and me 15) and I can't forgive him. ( I am over 20 now). He has never truly apologized or regretted it. And I am sorry for those who say It is just an age thing, for me It is not. 13 year-old people are mature enough to know they are fucking up your brain with their actions.Since he treated me this way, I can't help but think he is a bad person. As intjs know, that lead me to doorslaming him and he basically ceased to exist for me. Problem is that during this quarantine we were more close, unable to get out and I just can't be hypocrite and pretend everything is alright. Common sense is something that comes easily for me. I don't understand why someone would be so cruel to their own sibling without any reason.Since quarantine we've been fighting a lot. I don't have the will to live anymore.Family just drains me and they are only a bunch of people together by blood bonds. Bad thing is  I need the money of my family to graduate. I just want to get away to somewhere where backstabbing is not something common.My parents fucked up my mind and my brother too. I have no one.Not claiming that I am a victim, but being around them trigger me. They think I am lazy but I just can't function well around them.

Not mind games, not feeling superior and putting you down.  I am so loyal but I just can't find anyone that don't break my trust into many pieces. My dad always criticize me over tiny details, I feel like I am an object which function is pleasing him ""being perfect"" to show off to others.I think my heart is locked forever.I promised to me after this huge fight I won't ever fight with anyone again.It is better to just put a mask, gray rock and pretend everything is alright, which is so hard for me.I don't want everyone to be perfect, I just think some mistakes can be accepted and others tell about your morals deep down- I would never bully anyone, put anyone down without any reason, just to be mean. It is hard for me to accept that I don't have genuine connections. I am sad.I just wanted to vent.I feel so ashamed of myself specially because everyone that listened to us fighting.

24,intj,"Hello! I am writing this for my own purposes, but in general, I think it would be interesting discussion to learn why you enjoy certain gifts and how you feel cared for. I realize this often varies person to person. But I am particularly interested in the ""why"". For example, an INTJ and ESFP can both appreciate a dinner, but perhaps for different reasons.I find INTJ's fairly low maintenance and not having that many obvious ""needs"" and ""wants"" that can be easily capitalized on. Also, the strong independence/withdrawnness makes it difficult for me to pinpoint what y'all appreciate.For example, do you appreciate a homebaked cake more than a specially bakery bought cake? (assuming the bakery bought isn't some random grocery store cake, but the gifter went out of their way to purchase something special) This has been an interesting debate amongst my friends of various MBTI, because some really zero in on the hand-made aspect, for others both are equal, and some appreciate the effort to get something nice from a special bakery and feel cared for because you were not cheap towards them.","What kind of gifts and gestures do you appreciate, make you feel special, and your reasoning as to why?

29,intj,"So i'm in the last year of school and i''m obviously contemplating as to what take in college. For the longest time I prized my practicality and decided that i was going to go for a commerce/finance career. And my reason for that was: it is a fairly safe route as you will end up with a decent job and rising into a high position in a company is also possible. Also if you navigate the field properly, your financial returns will be higher than average. I've always felt like it was a career that guarantees returns. (Exceptions apply)But now that i'm at the end, people keep reminding me to go for something i like and i'm interested in or I will regret it later. So now my long standing plans are being threatened and I'm staring to consider subjects like psychology(or English lit.) I've always liked humanities and I'm fairly good at it too comparing to a number- centric career like commerce. But I've also felt like it takes longer time and much more effort to achieve highly in the careers that entail these subjects in contrast to a work intensive job like the ones in commerce.\*Also the reason why i was adamant about commerce in the beginning was also the vast migration opportunities it gives as I'm desperate to go abroad.So now the question is it too risky or foolish to follow the dreamy ""do what you love"" path and is it just better to stick to the practical and sure/safe path?It's conflicting because i pride myself on being a level headed person and the  ""do what you love"" path just for some reason feels too fantastical to be practical (probably due to capitalism, but you know what i mean....)NOTE: I don't hate commerce/finance, but I don't love it either (i'm quite neutral about the subject and the career.)

We have a very old family friends I don’t know them well. They helped me find a place, I have thanked them, called to ask how they are and went to their home with cookies. They live in a newly built area with unfinished streets, literally alleys and not much directions, it had snowed, they sent me the location, came out of car at the same place, called them and asked for more directions. Her husband and daughter came after me, I sent them my location, give as many instructions as I could and I was on the phone the entire time, the husband talked a bit aggressively and would ask where I am, what direction cars go, main street or the alley( they all were literal narrow streets  no  directions and dead ends and few one floor houses. I immediately  found  the street names and told them, they found me 20 seconds later. The husband was mad, I felt horrible and kept saying how sorry I am for three times. I felt miserable the entire time, they said I should have stayed in the car and contacted them first( logical, I totally understand). But their house was three minutes walk from where I was originally standing. I has also sent my location initially to the wife prior the the husband coming. They could literally tell me to walk straight and there I would  be, but they made a bug deal out of it( they have a logical point, I understand but walking is also an option no need for big fuss, I thought they had sent me their exact location where car took me) any ways, I felt Soooooo miserable the entire time and rarely talked, I did make few comments and asked few questions to not look too awkward.Their three daughters, son and daughter in law are all younger than me, the son in 21, bad education, smokes, drinks, is obese and tries to imitate his father( these are not acceptable traits for someone that young in our culture) now I’m the very opposite of that. I couldn't even look at the son or make comments about their dog, I felt as if the son and daughter in law (21) are much older and wiser and confidant than me, they acted very sophisticated, yet I exchanged few words with 16,18 year old daughters and felt more safe with them but still felt much lesser than them coz I’m not like them, I’m not as sophisticated, I cant make jokes and speak with a louder pitch voice, I cant sit relaxed and .... I watched their dog running around  for half an hour without saying a thing. I felt like crying, as if I’m much lesser than them  and they are judging me.I came home and felt like an idiot, it was only then I remembered I could spin of narratives, talked about something I’m good at. Sit more relaxed. Acted my age and the older one. Tell them that the street directions are bad and much different than my country so of course I would be confused but thanks for your good intentions and sorry for making you worried.

You must have mistyped yourself.""I think the title of my question is very clear, but since I often have problems with people not understanding things that seem obvious to me, I'll go into a bit more detail.I generally am more of a listener, and less of a talker, however when listening to other people talk I often hear them stating objectively false things, and then decide to chime in, and correct these mistakes (not with random people, just people I already know, and have an established ""relationship"" with.However often when I do correct those mistakes I am met with people saying things like:""Did I ask you (for your opinion)"" or: ""Was I talking to you?"" as a means of ""rebuttaling"" my correction. And this makes me angry beyond any reasonable measure for a multitude of reasons.First of: I do realize that just forcing yourself into an already established conversation can be considered rude, but I at least in my mind, I'm not doing that. I am correcting somebody so that they don't make the same mistake in the future, and immediately back out of the conversation again, because I'm not interested in being an active part of it anyway.But now, I'll detail exactly what makes me so angry about these ""rebuttals"".1. Did I ask/Was I talking to you implies that I am only supposed to talk, when spoken to, and this is honestly one of the most demeaning things I could ever imagine, and instantly ignites the flames of 1000 suns in me.2. Did I ask for your opinion especially implies that what I state/correct people about are opinions, which they are not. There is a huge difference between something as subjective as an opinion, and a fact/scientific consensus, and bluring the line between those two very distinct things is very infuriating to me, because they are so incredibly different, and it can lead down a very bad road. These two main reasons + the fact that most of the time, when I hear these sentences, they are said in the most smug and condescending voice ever, make me wanna scream:""I will talk whenever I goddamn want, and correct you as long as you remain wrong."" everytime I once again am confronted with them.I generally don't see real reasons to talk very often, but when I do decide to talk on my own volition, I want that what I say is both heard and taken into account, and not just batted-away, as if it was worthless.Does anybody else feel the same way?","Does anybody else get irrationally angry at people saying shit like:""Did I ask"" or ""Was I talking to you""?"

57,intj,"Long story short: I have a group for a class and we decided to take a quiz “together” to help each other out.

63,intj,"I'm wondering if anyone else has done this in their school/work/professional life:  Perhaps to my own detriment, I have a tendency to turn down job/career opportunities if a company's mission, actions, and products and/or services don't align with my ethics and values.  For example: I was hired to be the general manager of an adventure park, and I left the position when the owner asked me to report a problem bear. My issue was that the problem bear was created by the owner who had refused to bear proof company property which left easy access to all kinds of trash etc., and that he asked me to exaggerate the bear's aggressiveness in order to have it destroyed.   I left a lucrative serving position because I didn't agree with the way the restaurant sourced its food which was problematic to me for more than one or two reasons.   Recently, I was hired at a property management company and have reason to presume I can move up in the company quickly and be compensated well, better than I have been...probably ever. But, I don't jive with some aspects of the business, and I've decided to turn down the position, which is also due, in part, to having a seasonal summer Job I love.   In school, I changed majors more than I care to admit, and most of the time, I changed because I found some ethical flaw in the conventional career paths of the majors I didn't think I could live with. But I never took up what I really loved like religions or philosophy or sociology because they weren't practical.  Anyway. I find that I pass up on opportunities quite often. I don't know that I know anyone else who does this, and I sometimes feel silly about it and like I'll never get where I'd like to be financially.

Or maybe more clearly, because I actually love who I am as a person, Im just frustrated at the way the world seems to work?? I read too many things on MBTI on reddit today and just got frustrated at like, who -really- wants to date a female INTJ??? What?? It seems like from a distance, plenty of men (and let met just say this here, Im not saying \*everyone\* Im not saying \*all\* Im just saying this has been my experience/what I see&amp;read online) seem to like the idea of dating an INTJ female from a distance. As in ‘wow you’re super cool and badass and let me admire you and seem like I want to date you’. But up close and personal, it seems like they drift off to more hmm traditional gender role type women? I dont want to soften my personality or be less myself and less intense to make someone feel more comfortable.I wear dresses and skirts and do my make up and have perfume or whatever that would seem *feminine.* I don’t  mean I dislike traditionally 'female' things – my bedroom is all pink-. But at the end of the day I just don’t really *act* girly. I don’t need a huge emotional support system. Every time I read about type combos that should work, its like either enfps or entps and intjs. But it -always- seems to be a female enfp/entp and male intj. And I understand the male intj/female enfp scenario. Stoic guy is slowly warmed up by a bubbly girl who breaks past his barriers? But I have a lot of male enfp friends and they tend to drift towards female enfps mostly. (Still want that bubbly inspiring caring personality). I don’t know too many entps. But anytime I read things on reddit it definitely seems like its again, female entps and male intjs. I know female/intj is the rarest gender/type combination. So Im sure that accounts for a lot. And I’d say 9.9/10 days I don’t even care but this morning it just really bothered me.As a metaphor, I swear it feels like most men are ‘the rock’ and women are ‘the waves that crash against that rock’. And a lot of men say ‘oh I wish my partner would also be a rock because this is tiring’. But whenever she stops they seem to be a little ‘wait, where’d you go’. But most of the time, for most people, I -am- the rock. And I don’t really know if I’d want to find a partner who is ‘the waves’. That sounds exhausting to me too.

90,intj," **Describe yourself in as much elaborate detail as possible (that still renders you anonymous, or to a level of acceptable comfort)**It's kind of hard for me to effectively describe myself. I am not that good at understanding my personality or emotions in great detail such that I could give a colorful portrait of my personality. It would be more of a low-resolution description if it comes from me. It actually makes me a little envious that people in the MBTI and other personality-based communities are able to understand articulate themselves. My forte is in the analysis of external non-societal systems (natural sciences, mathematics, human-engineered systems, etc.). Maybe when I'm older I will develop a level of emotional maturity to be able to understand myself. Anyways, right now here is how **I** would describe myself as:Generally reserved, private, self-focused, able to get hyper-fixated on special interest, impatient, and yeah that's pretty much all I can think of.To help with the analysis, I will add descriptions of personality from other people that I have heard over the years:Quiet, hardworking, socially awkward, intelligent, friendly, funny, analytical, lazy (this is contradictory to hardworking, it came from a highly conscientious individual commenting on how disorderly I am), blunt at times, sometimes I am told that something I have said was rude even though I don't think it was. I am also told that I have a tendency to be paranoid/worry about the future. I have worked on this and learned to control my paranoia as I am aware that it could be seriously detrimental to mental health.**Why are you interested in knowing your type?**I am curious to understand where I fall on the MBTI scale with respect to the theory of cognitive functions. I want to see how this framework maps my thinking pattern. I already took the Big 5 aspect scale and with a fair degree of confidence, I think that it is accurate (low extroversion, low agreeableness, low conscientiousness, mid openness, high neuroticism) but now I want to see how my personality fits with the cognitive theory framework.**Do you go to work and/or you in school? If so, what field/occupation/subjects?**I work as Engineer in the telecom industry. My focus is primarily on designing the systems for the device to the radio. I enjoy my job and I have ambitions of becoming a technical expert in the field in the future. I want to develop a comprehensive knowledge of the entire network from the network as a whole (radio to the core and beyond) to the physics of the wireless channel (EM waves, wireless modulation schemes, channel effect, etc).Part of doing this will involve me writing two books (it will never be published, I am just writing them for my own knowledge and fun) covering wireless communications and the other covering the network holistically. My hope is that this combination of independent research and hands-on experience help me towards my goal of becoming a reputable expert in the field.I won't be pursuing a doctorate in the subject because I have had it with schooling. I have been going to school since I was 5 and now I think I'm finally done after my Master's. I always found the deadlines and pressure to quickly get work done in school to be stressful and I don't want to go through that stress and learn on someone else's time. I would rather research and understand this on my own.**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**I had a pretty strict upbringing as a child, particularly towards academics. My parents are really big on academic achievement and grades and all that. Most of the time they focused on teaching us math and literacy skills as kids even when we're on school breaks. I think I had a decent relationship with them, but this value on academics is still ongoing and even in my mid 20s they keep pushing me to do a PhD despite the (1) It would be a waste of time to pursue it given my current situation and (2) I don't want to do another 4 years of school.I responded to this negatively initially and was a D and C student initially. Once I got to high school and through college, it hit me how important it is and I became primarily an A student.I come from a pretty secular family. I guess I'd consider myself agnostic due to the lack of any evidence supporting the existence or nonexistence of God(s).**Do you need logical consistency in your life?**I mean I don't try to pick everything apart. My way of analyzing or understanding how something works is to observe it and try to piece information together and develop a comprehensive logical analysis of why something does or doesn't work or how it works etc. I don't deliberately try to look for loopholes first. I first develop the framework and add on to it later if I need too.Hopefully, this answers the question clear enough, if not let me know so I reframe it in a way so that it can be more understandable.**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about?**I'm curious only about the stuff I am interested in and I will research that specific topic. My curiosities could be anything from electronics to a video game to a sport or really any other system. I don't have ideas that are executable, more just ideas or thoughts on how or why something functions the way it does.**If money was not an issue, what career/job would you have?**I will not work unless I am paid for my efforts. If money wasn't an issue, then I would just sit at home all day and pursue my hobbies.**Are you a free spirit or do you play by the rules? If so, why?**I'm definitely more of a free spirit and I find rules and regulations to be suffocating. I don't really know how to explain why I'm a free spirit. Guess I was just born with it?**If I asked you to take a shot with a football how would that make you feel? Would you be able to do it well?

What would it be about? How would it make you feel?**Depends on what the essay was on.

I'd probably enjoy writing about some internal system I came up with idk.**Is it okay to crack a few eggs? If it makes an omelette? Do the ends justify the means?**As long as no one is getting hurt physically or the individual cracking the eggs is not committing a crime, then yes I think it's ok.**Do you put things back in their proper place?**This is something I have serious trouble with. It's the reason why sometimes people perceive me as a lazy slob.**How do you behave around strangers, acquaintances and friends?**I am generally reserved, private, and quiet around strangers and acquaintances. So much so that they think I am being rude. Around friends, I am generally more talkative and my sense of humor and such comes out. I can share my ideas and get into discussions with them on a variety of topics a lot more easily, I am more inclined to tell jokes, etc.**Do you have exquisite tastes that you would expend effort or money for?**I don't have any exquisite tastes. If I have something and it works and isn't a total piece of crap, then I'm cool with it.**How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**If it's within a domain of my competency then I would be thrilled to help. The reason though is because I kind of like to show of my knowledge/skill on that subject (a bit narcissistic but I'm just being honest here)**How long do you take to make an important decision? How would you go about it? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**Not very long. I actually decide on things quite impulsively sometimes. But then afterward I realize the flaws in my decision and then I start to change my mind rapidly.**If I asked you to design a plan of action, would it be easier to work alone or in a group? Do you ask for others opinion? or stick to your own guns?**Definitely would need to work alone on this. I strongly dislike working in groups because I don't like following through with the implementation of someone else's idea or their idea of how it should be implemented. I would much rather take my idea and go about my way of implementing it. Now if I run into an issue where I don't have the knowledge necessary to move on with the task at hand, then I would consult someone who knows about it and have them give me pointers on what to do next but ultimately everything will be done by me.**A weekend best spent looks like ...?**Alone at home with my hobbies**My biggest fears are ...**Failure of any kind. One of the reasons I would say for my low score in consciousness is the potential for failure which makes me fearful of strategizing and pursuing the things I want because if I pursue them and I fail then I will make a fool of myself and/or it will reveal and ugly/scary truth about reality or myself that I would not be ready to face. Most of my night terrors are based on failure lol. The other night I woke up hyperventilating thinking I failed a class and dropped out of Uni even though I'm already graduated.Another fear that I have, interestingly enough, is with psychedelic drugs. I know this sounds weird, but I find something downright terrifying about consuming a substance we know next to nothing about which is thought of as a key to ""consciously"" exploring our sub-conscious and all of our repressed insecurities and fears and how it could lead to existential dread. The fact that people come out from this experience and its potential for life long impact is scary as hell. Along with that, it shows just how little we know about anything at all which really amplifies the feelings of insignificance.**How much do you express yourself and what mediums do you do that through? Art? Writing? Talking?**I don't express myself very much. If I do I think the easiest way for me is by writing and if the discussion I am having with someone else is engaging enough, then talking.**Generally where do you lean politically? Is it every man for himself? Should people be pragmatic? Does the government need to step in and help people?**I don't know and don't care about politics.**Does it matter if something is factually correct for you to believe in it?**Yes. My decisions and opinions are based primarily on facts and empirical evidence.**Are emotions/feelings an important aspect of your life? If so, then why?**I hate the fact that I'm stuck with them. I try to ignore my feelings and emotions.**How attached are you to reality?**I don't believe I am super attached to reality. I am in my head most of the time in whatever daydream, fantasy, or train of thought I've been caught. The only time I'm in reality is if work needs to be done or if I'm engaging in physicalism hobbies like video games. But other than that I enjoy being in my own mind.**How thick skinned are you? Are you sensitive to criticism?**I would say I'm fairly thick skinned. I can take a joke pretty well and I get annoyed with people who get easily offended.",I need help with figuring out my type

This is taking a huge toll on him. - I was pregnant and we lost our baby. He hasn't opened up much about that but he said on some level he blames himself because it was his sperm that probably caused the miscarriage (chromosomal abnormality being a common cause of miscarriage). I've talked to him about how miscarriages are common, and that it's not his fault. - He has bad asthma and hasn't been able to socialize much with family and friends because of the pandemic, he seems to avoid zoom calls for some reason.- He's so focused on his lack of employment that he seems to be forgetting there are productive things he can do. He hasn't been exercising, eating healthy or working on the projects that are important to him, he seems to be focusing on the fact that he doesn't have work and pushing off literally everything else that could lead to him feeling better. He's even cutting back on taking care of hygiene because he doesn't want to be a financial burden by needing more than the bare minimum of those products (razors for example). -  Our son (enfp) has been homeschooled because of the pandemic which makes it really hard to focus when you're inside the house, and outside of the house there aren't any quiet work areas because, again, pandemic. - He has fallen into playing minecraft more than he probably should be, because it's the one place where he feels like he's able to actually be constructive.- I'm currently holding 3 positions workwise and I know that's probably messing with him a bit too. Although one is a volunteer position. - All of these things combined are effecting our sex life as well, specifically his ability to perform. Which is consequently also effecting our ability to conceive again, which I know is also stressing him out and creating a stress loop. I love him a lot and it's hard to see him struggling like this.

124,intj,"TL;DR: just reply to my title. Below is just my situationIm 18M and my mom and step-mom recently talked about how I lack experiences compared to their days filled with flings, sex, and friends.I don't believe I lack experiences, in fact some were really exhiliarating, but I do think, in a day to day or week to week basis, my life is somewhat bleak right now. Most of my experiences were dependent on my family or their finances rather than the external world, which imo where the best experience lies because of the uncertainty, risk, and independence factors.I have 'friends' but I don't hang out with them, my friendships just stops at the couple minute conversations at different intervals. My hobbies are pretty lack luster with a self defense program(krav maga, where the last time I attended a meeting was almost a year ago) and my track and field where progress is slow.I dont just sit around and watch my life as it succumbs to meaninglessness tho(im an intj too lol). I exercise 6 times a week to improve my physique, try to ace only the most important subjects, and want to expand my hobbies to cooking and music. I also have a whole day routine that I follow strictly else my day would be full of complacency and laziness.My problem is, my plans are too gradual, long-term, and lacks space to put in 'experiences'. I thought my plan was the way to make me the best man I can be but my peers can already drive cars, into modelling, and went to crazy parties. I'm not even comparing myself to popular and successful people but just random schoolmates.I feel like im missing out; missing something. I do a lot of things every day but they're just repeats; daily grinds.

It could be a combination of these factors. I don't know.I'm not a shot caller and being put in these positions makes me uncomfortable. I don't like being judged or watched because I feel like something is being expected of me. But at the same time, I either get too nervous and break becoming incompetent or I'm extremely competent.

175,intj,"For me, I actually have a quite interesting story to tell.When I was around 6, I went to daycare while my parents were away at work. I think I was okay with it. However one day, an incident happened. A girl came up to me and straight up took the toy away. As most of you will know, girls tend to be bigger and stronger around that age range. She was particularily big and was known to be a little bit of a bully. Did not have much of a relation before, but I straight up lost it. It is too far back to remember specifics but I basically ended up pinning her to the ground and choking her with my hands while on top of her until she let go of the toy and crying. I think a teacher had to stop me because I didn't let go.Obviously, this was a big deal and I got into massive trouble. My mother came and appologize that it won't happen again and the like. However, what she said on the ride back home is something that still lingers in my mind: ""I was worried that you were too nice but fortunately you are not a pathetic loser."" She said that to her 6 year old son. I didn't think much back then but damn. It was like her saying that what I did was at least acceptable. My mother was also an independent woman who succeeded with nothing but her own skills so I would imagine she had a little bit of handle-problems-yourself mentality. But still, damn. Anyways, I think that really shaped my personality from that point. In a good way, I became more independent, assertive, confident and ""pursuasive"". However, although I don't straight up choke people when they go against me, I can be classified as a bit manipulative and selfish.

If we were to get married then all new income would be collective. Old assets do not become collective. So in a case of a divorce, that would be split 50/50, but the house would remain mine. She is constantly reminding me that it is not ""our"" house but mine. I do not like that way of thinking because I would like to see her treat it as her own house and feel at home. But today I popped and got upset, how does providing a free roof above your head suddenly decrease her chances of ever owning one? Even in the case of a divorce... She is somehow stuck in a logical fallacy and I have tried to explain to her tirelessly that it doesn't make sense. As long as I earn more than her (mortgage deducted), she wins out even in a divorce..  But it doesn't seem to fucking register in her head..She apoligized about her poor choice of words after I got upset about it, but it really isn't registering with her that the game theory behind this is stacked in her favor at all scenarios.At this point I'm wondering whether I should just suggest her to get mortgage and buy 50% of the house, which would go into my personal assets... It's not actually in her best interest as she would be able to save less money. The only scenario in which this is in her best interest is IF this real estate is the best investment available. But I know plenty better investments than this. Even if she would buy the 50%, I would be getting a ton of cash to invest personally (and Mattheus Law..), I will get richer due to it being in personal assets and not the collective..Thoughts?",Am I the asshole?

Just because someone moved on fast doesn’t mean they didn’t care for the person.

252,intj,"(Thought it would be cool to introduce people who are not familiar with this. I think it has value)  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  There are 4 cognitive functions: intuition (N), sensing (S), thinking (T), and feeling (F).     The functions are divided into two perceiving (P) functions and two judging (J) functions.   Perceiving: Intuition, Sensing.    Judging: Feeling, Thinking.     The perceiving (P) functions take-in information. They do not process it. It is like a lens through which information is observed. Intuition (N) being a wide scope but with fewer detail and sensing (S) being a narrower scope but with greater detail.     The judging (J) functions process the information/ make judgment upon it:    The feeling (F) function in relation to social structure and relationships, value, personal self, feeling and such (more subjective) and the thinking (T) function on information, structure, logic, systems and such (more objective).     Each of the four functions can be in one of either two attitudes: introverted (I) or Extroverted (E).     The functions which are in an introverted attitude are directed at the inner world of the individual and tends to be more abstract as a result. The functions which are in an extroverted attitude are directed towards the outer more concrete world.     Each person has all 4 functions: two introverted and two extroverted. In every case, one of the introverted functions will be a P function and another will be a J function (one function to perceive the inner world and another to asses/ judge it). Same goes for the two extroverted functions: one will be a P function and another will be a J function (one to perceive the outer world and another to asses/ judge the outside world).     Using INTJ as an example; as this is an introverted type, the first function will be introverted, the second extroverted, the third introverted again and the fourth extroverted again (Ni, Te, Fi, Se).   \*\* In the case on an Extroverted the first function is extroverted, the second introverted, the third extroverted again and the forth introverted.     INTJ are Perceivers (not judgers or judgmental as often misunderstood) as their leading Ni function is a Perceiving function. The J at the end of INT-J makes the Thinking function extroverted (but as thinking is a secondary function in intjs, this still leaves INTJs as perceiving types).   \*\* An INFP on the other hand (Fi, Ne, Si, Te) is a Judging type since they lead with the Feeling (F) function which is a judging function (it evaluates information/ makes judgment in relation to it. In this case “feeling” information/ subjective).     I’ve come across some misconceptions about some of these things and thought I could maybe introduce the functions here. I think as far as understanding oneself and others, the functions make a much better job of it than the MBTI/ 16 personalities test (which in my opinion is not worded well, misses a lot of information and is more aligned with the big five personality test than with the functions which Jung spoke of). This has been a valuable tool for me in personal growth and understanding. Hope this was of interest.",Cognitive Functions - Introduction
253,intj,"I wonder if the love and hate of selfies on the INTJ forums is primarily a generational divide. Older INTJ who grew up when selfies was not being a thing hates it. While the younger INTJ who grew up with selfies being normal thinks it is great to see what everyone looks like and gets to contribute. I am in my 30s and here is my perspective of selfies. I generally dislike selfies. I see them as encouraging narcissism. When I grew up people took pictures of things, places, other people, or if it did include yourself it was usually with other people. You were never the focus of your own pictures. Selfies have changed the focus of the picture to yourself and not other people or places. So I see it as encouraging narcissism. I imagine the younger INTJs who grew up with selfies being normal, see it as a way to encourage people to have more self esteem in them selves, and to be like there friends. That not doing selfies makes them feel different then everyone else, and this selfie crazy is helping them be like there friends. That they get to  be part of the group.What does everyone else think.

I even took this test from this university that I forgot the name of and I got like a 91+, which was above average empathy.I feel like with Ni, we're very, very perceptive of people and how they feel, through means we're not entirely sure of ourselves. This is probably why I display INFJ traits sometimes, because of all the traits that I do have, empathy is pretty up there. I suppress it most of the time, because it brings me emotions of other people that I don't want to be experiencing. Sometimes suppressing it works, sometimes I just wish it had a turn-off button. I love being great with predicting how people would react, knowing how people truly feel, etc without them having to tell me. To me, it's power (Gee, thanks Te). And empathy has definitely made friendships stronger for me because I then use Fe/Fi to respond to them (don't get me wrong, im still very much aloof, but I do learn).Is anyone else an empathic INTJ? Remember: empathy is not all ""I know what you're feeling and I totally support you!"", no. Most of the time, it's feeling for yourself how other people feel. When they're stressed, you're stressed.

I didn't care about any of that, and I didn't care about what was happening then. I was ten and I was already wishing I was an adult.I wanted to live out there. Be independent. Not bound by social convention or whatever, but to live humbly in a house somewhere and work on my career. Feelings like this went even before the age of ten and even further than that. I held these feelings strongly. Adults were praising me because I was ""behaved"" and I liked to read. Because of this whole mentality, I really did not get to enjoy my youth as much as other people. Now, I'm still fairly young, but the looming presence of adult responsibilities is coming to get me sooner or later. I find that I regret it all. I wish I was a normal child who enjoyed his youth and played with his friends, and not like an eleven year old who's already had his existential crisis...

And for the first time in a few years, I'm having 3 meals a day, I'm sleeping 8 hours at night and I'm waking up at 7am.It sounds healthy but I feel like I'm losing myself and it's bothering me a lot...I go to work, and when I come home, I watch some videos because I'm tired and then I go to bed after dinner, and that's it. My day is over, starting again at 7am after 8 hours of sleep. I still have some time for myself since it's not a full-time job *yet*, but in a few months it will be, and it scares me. I'm afraid of entering a ""dormant state"", of being stuck in autopilot mode and realizing one day that I've spent 20 years in this company without noticing it, and that an entire part of my life is now gone, and that I didn't do anything important or meaningful during my existence, and that I'm now old, and that I've wasted my time, and that I'm nobody. I can't exactly escape this situation because it's not only about me, and I need this job. I know this is how life is supposed to be, and that this job is objectively a good thing, but it feels like a trap. Is this a trap ?Oh and from what I've seen in fiction, INTJs finally managing to escape the ""dormant state"" after too much time can be a bit extreme and panicky : Walter White, Agent Smith from *The Matrix*, Kirei Kotomine (Fate)... so I'm concerned about that as well.","Afraid of entering a ""dormant state"""

320,intj,"Hi there,As the title says, I am looking for a penpal. I am Eren (pronunciation: Aaron), 20 years old, living in the Netherlands and am an INTJ. I'm a practicing Muslim, have been practicing since a fairly young age (I consciously chose to study and eventually profess Islam myself, no spoon-feeding). People describe me as a precise, rational and open-minded person. I am someone in whose head ideas about anything and everything constantly pop up. One minute I'm pondering how it came to be that protesters invaded the Capitol (what was the starting point, contributing factors, external influences), and the next I'm pondering what is the best economic system we as humanity could/should adopt. I mean, suppose there is an alien civilization out there somewhere, and they were to visit Earth. The hypothetical fact that they would visit Earth, that very likely means that they have put aside (most of) their differences and worked together as one race to go intergalactic. Then they would come here and see us still fighting like cavemen with each other over resources, racism and other petty things. What a shame that would be then! Anyways I digress.At the moment I am studying Physics. I'm developing an app for the App Store (although this is currently on hold due to great workload)  and making youtube videos. Other than that, I really enjoy reading books and articles. I read about various topics, but what occupies me the most is religion, politics, and business with a touch of economics. I don't like fiction unless it's really, really good. Why searching Penpals?With having a penpal, I hope to find someone with whom I can spar about ideas, visions and more. Let me make this explicit: my intention here is not for the sake of friendship(s), but purely to find a conversation partner. I am very particular with whom I deal. However, after an X amount of time, I do not exclude friendship provided the correspondence is challenging/pleasant enough, of course for both sides.I am not a talkative person. When I think about something, I put a lot of energy and effort into it to come to a good conclusion. In my opinion, a correspondence of 1 to 2 times a week is a good amount. If you are also interested in something like this, please send me a private message with a description of yourself and why this penpal-thing seems worthwile for you. The reason for this is so we can hopefully align our expectations to prevent wasting each others time.",Penpal - 20/M/Netherlands
321,intj,Genuine question. I see this stereotype often and it befuddles me.,Why are ENTPs attracted to INTJs? Or are they?
322,intj,"Hello, fellow INTJs!I do not tend to post often, but I need an external point of view, on this matter. I feel torn between my emotions, and I need advice, before I go bonkers, hahaha.But, first, a bit of background. In typical INTJ fashion, I have always liked to be on my own, and to spend time by myself, even when I was a child. This independence never really bothered me, and it even helped me to build myself back up in tough times, when no one was truly there for me. Because, yes, I have suffered from bullying when I was in middle school.Since then, I have worked on my issues with my awesome therapist, and have come to understand my anxiety, and make peace with my past wounds. Why am I telling you all this? Because it might relate to the questions I have.Throughout my life, many people have told me that my desire to spend time alone is not natural. That I may have problems, or a weird personality, bla-bla-bla. And with time, I have come to internalize those beliefs. That I am weird, and not normal. And so, I feel guilty whenever I want to spend time alone. I am always watching out for when I could socialize more. But the more I do that, the more it drains me. And, on top of that, I feel like I am not being true to myself.I do not think I have social anxiety, because I can function just fine with other people. It is just that I really like being on my own. But, the people around me, mainly extroverts, constantly tell me that I should make more friends, find a romantic partner, and so on. I know they mean well, but it's starting to make me feel like I'm some kind of weirdo that will end up all alone in life. What the hell?So, my question is this : how do I feel confident about my INTJ self? How do I embrace my solitude without being guilty about it? In short: am I being normal about this? Should I make an effort to socialize more, or listen to my guts? I'm pretty lost, I guess.Thank you in advance for all your answers! And feel free to ask me questions, since this post might not be very clear, haha. Thank you, guys!",INTJ in need of guidance.

339,intj,"Sorry for the longer post, but it might prove relevant to *you specifically* lol.Critical science part: Alright so, let's clear the air here: MBTI is sort of pseudoscience. It's not the worst out there and has some basis in reality, but it's always seemed a little strange to me when people start talking about ""Fe"" and ""Dominant Ni"" or whatever. I've read a book or two about MBTI and a bunch of Jung's work (which seems to be what MBTI is largely based on), and it's mostly just speculative. Don't get me wrong, Jung is one of my favourites (am a psych student) and speculation is very fun, but I wanna be honest about what it means to be a so-called 'INTJ'. Unless there's been some cutting-edge research within the last 5ish years I'm not aware of, MBTI apparently has no real predictive power. Just from my experience, those online MBTI tests don't even seem to be great measures of things like 'introversion' or whatever else they're trying to test. That's all to say, INTJ isn't really an archetype, all it says about you is the answers you chose to give during your MBTI test.Less science-y part: If you're looking at anecdotal samples, like let's say, INTJs who also joined the INTJ sub, you're going to find lots of examples of people who seem to have similar personalities. This is especially true if you're in an environment that rewards acting like a stereotypical INTJ (ahem ahem, a sub for INTJs). Now look, I'm not juuust trying to rain on everyone's parade, because I reckon it's cool to think about grouping personality traits into types. Making a community around a neat little theory is also sorta fun and can be a good place to chat. However, the real point of this post is to tell you to not base your identity around being an INTJ, because it's not actually a real thing. If I proposed a study to a reputable psychology journal using anything remotely close to the methods used in MBTI, I'd be laughed out of the room (or... email box now? Idk). Regardless, it's also not healthy to create a self-image like that, which is probably what's going on inside a good portion of you. Hell, when I was a young (edgy edgy arrogant edgy) teenager on this sub years ago, I did that exact thing. And, to anyone who's pissed at the selfies because they shouldn't have a place in this sub, or that the people posting are ""miStYpEd""? Jesus, stop taking yourself and those four funky letters so seriously. They don't hold any power, and they barely even hold any meaning. Keep in mind, I'm annoyed by the selfie spam, I'm annoyed by any spam (and it's cool if you're JUST annoyed by the spam). But if you didn't like the selfies *before* they were spammed (be honest with yourself on this one), then I think you should take my words a bit seriously.Anyway, if you disagree, please share your view. I think the idea behind MBTI is super interesting, and would be super happy to find some sort of evidence that it isn't just a moderately better horoscope.",Let's talk about what MBTI actually is.
340,intj,"Even though I'm here on this sub, I really don't understand the idea of grouping people based on few generic questions. The concept of personality types sounds very dubious to me. The answers to the questions can be highly circumstantial hence making the concept/ logic of personality type very questionable to me. I've seen many people getting the same personality type yet having varied behavioural pattern and quite different approach to their individual lives.I feel like these type of things help people in coping up with their drawbacks/insecurities and masquerade it as their “personality type” while what they should do is work on these short-comings.

I would then stay by their side or hold them until they finished, and then they would never mention it or talk about it, even if I ask or let them know I'm open to listening.I'm wondering if this is a usual thing for INTJs. Other types I have dated, they might get emotional or swing their moods, but they'd let it out a lot more often and usually they'd let me know what is on their mind, even just in general terms, when they are crying. Often they'd want to vent or talk about it or something afterwards.

499,intj,"I’m an INFP female and met this guy a few weeks ago. We had a great first date just getting to know each other and drinking and eventually had sex (which was also great). We texted on and off, and a couple days later he asked if I wanted to hang out again. We had another great time together and I ended up spending the night. However, after that I didn’t hear from him (at all) for a couple days and just assumed he had lost interest. I’m not the kind of person to double text or start a conversation if the other person doesn’t seem interested, so I just gave him some space and thought if he wanted to reach out again then he will. He also seems to be very busy with work most days so I tried to keep that in mind as well. After 2 or 3 days of silence he ends up snapchatting me like nothing was wrong, and we talked back and forth on snap for awhile before I finally mentioned something along the lines of how I’d ‘love to see him next week if he’s not busy but no worries if not’. He responded right away and said yes (??) even though he gave me no indication that he wanted to hang if I hadn’t said anything. Now I’m just completely confused because he never seems very interested in texting or talking outside of being together in person, and he’s usually the one that stops replying to texts or snapchats. We’ve only hung out twice, but I genuinely felt like we got along really well and it normally takes me an incredibly long time to actually let my guard down and catch feelings for someone, but with him it happened so fast. I’m completely 100% fine with giving him the space he needs and taking things very slow, but I honestly can’t tell if he’s just not that interested and is trying to be nice by still communicating (in a half ass manner) or if this is just how he is? Does he actually want to hang out again or should I not bring it up if he doesn’t either? I’ve never tried going on dates an INTJ before and I’m losing my mind trying to figure him out. I shouldn’t even be so invested at this point but I am and I hate it lol",Does it sound like this INTJ guy is interested or should I move on?

Here’s my new list:- Start a new business and be my own boss - Eventually succeed in my business to a point where I can regularly work only 20-25 hours a week and still make a living, reserving time for hobbies and healthy work/life balance - Build a small (less than 1500 sq ft) custom house with a big bathtub, dedicated art studio space, &amp; enough land to have a small garden - Travel internationally once a year while I’m young-ish (Thailand, the Maldives, Japan, Iceland, Norway/Finland/Sweden, Indonesia, Cambodia, India, etc)- Get 2 surgeries I’ve been putting off (nothing life-threatening, but would decrease discomfort in the long run)- Sculpt &amp; cast a ball-jointed doll of my own design - Meet my “safety-net” savings goal, then start putting $ away for retirement on a regular basis - Permanently upgrade my cats’ diet to fancier, more expensive, healthier food - Either finish or toss out all my creative in-progress projects, so I can start enjoying art again with a blank slate- When the pandemic’s gone, get back into swimming at least twice a week - Get acupuncture 1-3 times a month- Learn Japanese, at least to a conversational level- Dye my hair an unnatural color at least once - Get 3 medium-large tattoos (but only after traveling to Japan and enjoying onsen first)Unfortunately a lot of these hinge on my new business doing pretty decently.

What kind of questions could you ask to understand if they use Ti or Ni? Or what kind of other signs of Ti use or Ni use could I look for?The reason for why I want to do this is mostly curiosity.

570,intj,"I am the eldest daughter, I got into prestigious college far from my hometown and that was the first time i was ‘free’. However, i was still tied. With a new place and new people, i started to discover my identity when i was 18. I had a lot of people with the same mind as me and that was my greatest experience in my life. I blame myself for letting them to tie me. But towards the person you love, you cannot help but to give in. I was taught to be respectful but the rebellious me, or that’s what they say just do whatever I want as long as my beliefs are not wrong. To them, all my doing is wrong. To be the first one to try new things mean to be the first to get hated, scolded, and that leaves be in depression for 2 years. They are conservative while i am quite liberal. I respect their opinions and I want them to respect mine too. When i asked whether what i was doing wrong, they just said they hated them. But afterwards, when my siblings are doing them, they seem to be okay with that.Sometimes i wonder, is it worth the hate? Why do i have to be the person who is weirder than them? I love them and will forever love them but i am just tired, to be careful to talk and act around them. And because of that, they labelled me as useless. How can i do something without getting their nerves?I don’t blame them I screwed in college, it is my fault. Also, they are no longer themselves in the past. And i am currently happy with them. It’s just i am forever a problematic person to them even without doing anything, well not doing anything is a problem. Funny about the amount of me saying “see i’ve told you before” I know a 23 shouldn’t have been talking about this but yeah, sometimes this thing will come into my mind and haunt me. I wish i am ‘normal’ and not problematic to them because to me i seem normal. I wish I wasn’t the first person to change because I don’t think I deserve the hate. Imagine being questioned and hated for every single thing you do from the ones you love the most. pain. I don’t mind about the others they can hate me their whole life and see me do nothing to them.",I am not weird

He’s an introvert by nature and only has a few best friends, and they all know of me but none of them have met me. We started dating 7 months before covid hit so to be fair I understand that most of them are quarantining as he himself hasn’t seen them for almost a year (which sucks as well), but when I ask when are we gonna do a group thing when covid is over? He almost hesitates and says idk... and then finally the other day he said to me “why would I introduce you to my friends? You can meet them when we get engaged. Friends only want to meet girlfriends or boyfriends so they can judge one another”, although I was super flattered by the proposition of a potential engagement on the horizon, I couldn’t help but feel is this normal? Do all INTJs keep their private life private to that extent? Why would he care if they judge? Help? Any feedback would be much appreciated.Thanks",Meet his friends?

Have you guys ever pushed away people because of the fear that you'll let someone in too close and they would judge you for stupid reasons, afraid of getting your trust broken again, etc? I don't have a lot of friends which does not bother me, I only befriend people I like or I really get along , but the twist that happened last year was that I became part of a social group that is very different from my usual circle, they're filled of extroverts, feelers, etc. I got sucked into it because of my XNFP friend -_- at first i didn't really want anything to do with them but as time flew I found myself hanging out with them very often (online). I ""feel"" like our ""friendship"" was too easy for them, like they just got close to me easily because of the XNFP, and befriending me is not an easy task lmao. I have a hard time thinking if they really are my friends because for me, they're just people I hang around with for fun but we don't really connect emotionally, and intellectually which I really value in friendships. That's why when my XNFP asked if I consider these people my friends I said no, of course he was a bit disappointed. But the question got me thinking, when the pandemic is over of course social gatherings are inevitable, maybe they would want me to hang out with them, pry into my private life which I am not ready for because the jury's still out with them and I think that they may feel differently when we really get to see each other personally because I am very reserved, quiet, and intimidating, the traits that are completely different from the online persona they have met.  So in result, I am pushing them away, I am trying to keep them at their lane so they don't get too close to me, I wouldn't be able to handle them and I'm afraid they will judge me(I come from a family that is pretty well-known and reputable, they don't know that yet and that's a factor why I am feeling this way) , betray me, and won't really understand me. I also have failed to mention that 2 people in that social group offended me real bad, that they said evoked childhood trauma and past hurt. I didn't confront them about it because I don't want to seem vulnerable and a crybaby (in this social group banter really is normal) but it's haunting me, it keeps bothering me because the two people who said that are the people whom I hang around a lot compared to anyone else and whenever they compliment me there's something in me that thinks they are faking, that they are insincere. I am planning on ghosting them for a while and I am really trying to understand myself why I am doing this pushing away of people, I have never done this before because I had no one to push away so it feel a little foreign. I know that we are known for not caring about what people think, I didn't really care about other people too but this particular situation is really taking a bit of toll on me.",Pushing people away

720,intj,"Fellow INTJ here i have trouble voicing my opinion and it's bugging me, a lot a person who can't voice their opinion is a person with basically no freedom, how did you practice to get better? Should i improve my language? Should I train myself with an extroverted thought process because most extroverted people can talk really fast and ace shit, or should i just write my opinions on paper before expressing them? I seriously need some advice or help, I'm 16 years old so I dont know if drugs are out of the question but i may be down depending on which one",How do you voice you're opinions
721,intj,"**SITUATION:** Im living with my cousin who was diagnosed with Leukemia at the age of 17. Im not exactly taking care of her, as I was busying myself and not really putting my pride aside to offer a helping hand. She doesnt see me as someone who can really help her (more of a “i dont want to ask my friends for help” way). Shes very clingy to her mom, who kind of spoiled her rotten. She whines a lot to her mother but never whines to me, and Im only around so she can talk to someone of similar age and listen to her teenage problems, a lending ear. But it breaks my heart to see her not even try. She’s very dependent on her mom, and always wished her mom was around even though she has a business to tend to. She speaks to her by whining, and gets angry at her mom who sacrificed so much, but also raised her to be this spoiled. She doesnt eat her veggies, and hardly has the willpower to become stronger and more that what she already is. Shes at the brink of death, and shes not even trying. **Shes stagnating, basically.**Ofcourse theres a given amount of dependency she needs, she has cancer.While recovering from chemo, she spends her days scrolling on instagram/tiktok/whatever and has a high interest in kpop. It’s difficult to strike up a deep conversation with someone who distracts themself all the time and never thinks hard about themself. She never gave herself time to become mentally strong and pull through things. **She gives up and the first sign of opposition.**Theres all these things i want to show to her like gratitude for your parents, pushing yourself the extra 1% everyday, how much people think about her, and basically become a well adjusted person after all this.The only thing i can think of is giving her the straight talk like a parent would. There could also be a gradual/subtle way of teaching this, my only idea being showing her works of fiction like streaming some great emotional story games like Undertale for her. She passively watches anime/kdramas, but doesnt really absorb it/take it to heart. So i thought experiencing fiction with her would help highlight what matters.I know her mental state is off, close to depression. Just living for the sake of it. Energy levels is akin to feeling heavy all the time (probably due to muscle loss and malnutrition) and **just wanting to lie down all day, and only finding peace in sleeping. Not wanting to face the world, nor herself.**In the end, i want her to succeed and be a great person.Note: Therapy is a very foreign idea to me and her family, its just never been on the table. It would be hard to convince her parents of hiring a therapist, adding on to the cost.**TLDR:** How can you convince a stubborn and unwilling person to become more introspective and become more independent? Is it possible? Also what other subreddits would help me get her perspective/help with this?",How to teach someone introspection?
722,intj,"Ok I'm confused lol, my brain seems to work using mostly ni and te (I've also done the keys2cognition test) but I'm not as emotionless every other intjs, I mean I am emotionless but only with people I don't like, instead if I like someone at first glance I easily open to them (not to my deepest part but I usually express emotions). I mean thinking about it I express only positive emotions (and anger) but still I am not a robot as other intjs would describe themselves, is this normal or I could be mistyped?(Sorry for my bad English and thanks in advance)",I'm confused

724,intj,,Do any of you fuckers smile? Or is it against the rules..
725,intj,"This was at the beginning of the pandemic when (we’re in the states) the shelf’s were being cleared out of cleaning supplies, toilet paper, and water.We had a sick family member with a lung disease who we were purchasing groceries for, wiping down with bleach and dropping them off at their door. Yet, we were running low on supplies so we woke up very early one day and were driving from city to city trying to find supplies but were out about 3 hours and unable to find anything. I’m not sure what the word for it would be but I have the ability to spot things faster/ better than others. For example, we were driving past a gas station and upon glancing their way I was able to spot a single case of water, inside the store, despite him driving about 50 MPH and it was only a second.We were at our 10th store when we were walking and I saw a bleach bottle out of the corner of my eye, shoved to the back of a shelf. I directed my INTJ there and he picked it up and said “How did you see this?” I just shrugged and kept smelling the candles. A few minutes later, I did it again. I found a bleach container in addition to some bleach spray and germ spray on a disheveled make up aisle. We were at the back of the store... I don’t remember why we were standing still... when a man walked up to us and gestured at our cart and said “Where did you find the bleach? I’ve looked every where.” My spouse gestured his thumb at me and said “She saw them.” We then begin discussing the pandemic, lockdown etc.He then wishes us a good day and begins to walk off. I audibly gasp, get a huge smile of excitement on my face, grab my husbands arm, shake it gently and say, “Baby! We have two! Let’s give him one! We don’t need both!!”And then what I thought I’d never experience. The death glare. Him “What?”“Yes! Baby, we only need the one, and then I got these sprays, right? Let’s give him one. Oh, he’s getting away (nudges him) baby, go catch up with him.”My hand was lightly resting on the cart when he *jerked it away from me* and said “Baby... when the zombie apocalypse comes. Stay close to me. I mean that.” TL; DR: It took three years, a world wide crises and a pandemic. But my INTJ husband finally gave me (ENFP) the death glare after I suggested we share our cleaning supplies.",The one and only time my INTJ husband gave me the death glare

742,intj,"I don't know if anyone posted about that topic before but I'm drunk right now and wondering if my 'addictions' have anything to do with being INTJ.So I realized that I'm using substances like cannabis, chemical drugs, psychedelics and alcohol more often than the average person and I tried to find the reason for that. I figured that I often smoke weed or drink a few drinks when I feel kind of overwhelmed with (the amount of) my thoughts and it made me think wether that has anything to do with being an INTJ, even though I read that INTJs are the personality type that's less likely to develop an addiction (or does drugs in general).To come to a point; do you think about or even do drugs when you are overwhelmed by your thoughts? If not, what do you do instead? Or do you even get overwhelmed?Sorry for mistakes. Like I said, I'm kinda drunk and english isn't my first language.",Alcohol/Drug usage

749,intj,"I am interested to see what kinds of areas fellow INTJs have struggled with in terms of their intellectual development, and whether they tend to be more conceptual (making sense of a completely novel reasoning framework), intellectual focus and prioritizing (such as paying the appropriate amount of attention to detail, understanding which concepts are more or less important to understanding a new framework), mental performance-related (memory, etc), or something else altogether (spatial reasoning, making sense of what counts as reliable evidence, etc.)For myself, a consistent challenge when adapting new knowledge has been in being able to gauge the reliability of certain solutions or conclusions, in the absence of a general understanding for what is ""reasonable"" in that field. For example, I would have difficulty ""sanity testing"" the results of a simulation, or the lag time of a system, or what constitutes a significant research paper out of the multitudes. I am sure this is normal to some extent, but I believe it takes me a longer time to get a sense for what is appropriate for a given system, without a fair amount of experience, whereas some colleagues (particularly Ti user ones) seem to have more of a knack for this, and can extrapolate from fewer amount of results, making me wonder if this is just innate to Ni processing in general.I look forward to your feedback.","What has been your greatest, or most consistent intellectual challenge up until now?"

I am an INTJ, and I know it’s borderline crazy to even take this test super seriously, but I fall under all the traits. All my life I’ve never managed to make genuine friends. Somehow I’ve always been the laughing stock. Sometimes made fun for my weight, looks, or just my personality. I fucking hate myself so much, I made friends in my high school as well, but again no one takes me seriously. I changed up, I lost weight and always work on my dreams, but what’s the point when you don’t have anyone to share it with?Everyone I know in my life is significantly older than me. I’ve also never dated before, never anything. My negative qualities are something that I know I need to work on, and I don’t even want to be this way. Like holding extreme grudges, procrastinate a LOT, and have serious trust issues. I just hate myself. I’m sorry. I don’t feel I deserve to be an INTJ. Whatever I am, just doesn’t suit me.

786,intj,,A rather refreshing trend in this sub so here’s mine!
787,intj,"My 28m boyfriend is an INTJ and I am a 29f INFJ. We've been dating for 8 months now, but have known each other for 6 yrs in total. Ever since I've known him, hes been a pretty reserved guy. Quiet, shy, a tad awkward, not very expressive, not affectionate, not flirty, not very excitable. The best word to describe him is just mellow. He seems aloof on the outside but deep down he does have a mushy core. It takes a lot of time for him to open up and trust ppl. He's had the same friends all his life, he's a very loyal guy. I think it took him years of observing me and gathering info to convince himself to ask me out 😆 but I think once he made up his mind, he was determined to date me. Something I've come to observe about my boyfriend is how he acts when he is drunk. He's an entirely different person, like he does a complete 180°. I hate to admit it, but I prefer him drunk.... He's so touchy and cuddly, always booping me on the nose, gives me kisses, hold my hand, stares at me and smiles from ear to ear, he will play wrestle with me and laugh like a little kid, tell me I'm beautiful and says I'm the best, and his sex drive goes thru the roof! When I tell you he acts the total opposite when he's sober....its like im dating 2 different guys. He can be so unromantic and acts like were in a platonic relationship when he's sober. We do see each other almost every day, and I'd say he likes to drink at least once a week when I'm over.  Any INTJs have this happen to them when they drink? Or anyone dating an INTJ have something similar happen with their s.o? It makes me wonder if drunk him is what he strives to be, but he's struggling to open up. I thought after 8 months of dating he'd open up to me, but he's still so closed off at times... it makes me wonder if he will ever open up. He has mentioned to me a handful of times he has a lot of feelings, he just doesn't like to show them.I do love my boyfriend. I am also an extremely loyal person and cant see myself leaving him. But sometimes his lack of emotional and physical intimacy does cause an issue for me. I need physical and emotional intimacy in a relationship, but he is okay with just spending lots of quality time together. I've told him I need affection and he says he does his best, but it makes him feel uneasy mostly.  Tldr:  INTJ boyfriend is only emotionally and physically affectionate with me when he is drinking. I prefer when he's drunk because he actually opens up to me. We've been together 8 months but have known eachother 6 yrs. Will he ever open up to me sober?

Whatever that was ended in May and I'm still struggling.Like today I got a piece of information from the past and now I'm an emotional wreck, and for the past year I've been on a mood of constantly feeling down. When I feel a bit better, something related to this person haunts me down and I'm down again.We dated 4 years ago, then she left because she wasn't ready for a relationship. A year after I get in a new relationship and she comes telling me she has feelings. A year later, that relationship ends, she says she has feelings, then she wants to date me without calling it a relationship because she's not ready. So we ""date"" for 6 months and then in May I ask if she'd be with me if she was ready. She said yes. Then she ""breaks up"" with me again. And today I discovered that she got in a relationship with someone else in June.I wish she was a bad person, but she's not, and that's why it's so hard to believe that I'm not unlovable, and this coupled with covid isolation is just too damn hard. Rationally I know I'm lovable, but part of my brain is resisting to believe it. So annoying.Maybe my biggest mistake was that I was always trying to rationalize her behavior, and also believing her when she said she wasn't ready due to xxx personal reasons. Because fatcs say she obviously was ready. Then it was me.And also I just feel very stupid for being stuck on the same person for four years and I don't know why I can't get over her.",Do you ever feel unlovable?

Well it may have escaped your notice but being the same type as Elon Musk does not make you him. Being INTJ does not make you instantly right about everything. You are not mind readers or oracles because of Ni dom. You are not specialists in everything and sometimes I even get the vibe that besides the type you have very little to offer and you are pretty narrow-minded. I also feel like all of yours stereotypical INTJ traits are sooooo overexaggerated that it is almost painful and fake. Honestly it is sad because I smell some pretty low self-esteem and FYI bringing other people down won't make it better. The type does not make you special even if it is the rarest one. However your work does make you special and it does make you specialist. And for f\*\*\* sake it is a post on the internet so chill. Don't post a selfie if you don't want to.

As a flex and an act of sharing here are my results:&gt; Skeptics are just that — skeptical. Not only do they question new information that they receive from others, but they also tend to treat their own thoughts and ideas with some suspicion. They tend to focus this critical perspective on the present, allowing their views to develop as they come across more information. **Approximately 5% of the populace are Skeptics.** &gt;**You are Reflective**: You dislike jumping to conclusions quickly. You’re adept at reflecting on your own thoughts. When it looks like your intuitions might be leading you astray, you don’t have a problem overriding them — instead, you take the time to re-evaluate the situation and figure out the wisest course of action.&gt;**You are Subjective**: People and stories interest you more than facts and figures do; you focus on the essence of ideas over the details. Your mind is more qualitative than quantitative. This trait lets you focus on the big picture over the nitty-gritty.&gt;**You are Carefree**: You tend to live in the moment. You don’t waste a lot of emotional energy fretting about the future. Instead, you focus on getting the most out of life right now.&gt;**You are Skeptical**: You treat new information and ideas with caution and skepticism. Spurious arguments rarely fool or confuse you, and your beliefs are based on the foundations of hard logic. You possess a fine-tuned BS detector.I also scored ✨70% higher✨ than past testers.

847,intj,,"INFPs and ENFPs are on the Selfie Sunday kick, so here’s my most INTJ selfie."
848,intj,"Hey everyone, first post here;As a pure INTJ (even my name and astrological sign reinforce my INTJ traits!) I put quite a bit of focus on my career in my life and being the best at something. During my studies and just after I was erudite in my field. I had less hobbies than the average person, also I turned my hobby into my career, so that’s one less hobby!Now I always felt like I didn’t have nearly as much success over the years than people who had -no false modesty here- less talent and put in less work. Over the years I underperformed, was not given as many opportunities to work, even though all my efforts were focused towards the work. It’s like I’m lacking success despite deploying maximum efforts over many years, compared to someone who would be much more casual. I am able to say that even though my judgement on myself is of course partial, the quality of my work is not in question, and is good enough at the very least. I do great when I am in a structure: a company or when there is a test or exam or a grant, but most of the time due to the nature of the job, I evolve in a freelance environnement where it is often more important to immediately look friendly and quickly create a bond to do networking, and where a frivolous or fun attitude is rewarded with more work compared to the stern attitude that I appear to have.Also now after a few years of a vicious circle, have less experience than people my age, so I can’t even be super competitive on work quality or experience like I used to. I did have to immigrate to a different country, speak a different language  –it doesn’t help with friendliness when you don’t get all the jokes— and I had to restart from the bottom up a few times in different cities, but even then I can notice people who progress faster in the same environment.Long story short, I think I am a victim of my INTJ personality and I suspect people perceive me. I think I come out as dull, work-oriented, not fun. The other day I had a laugh because I realized I am like an unsuccessful, mediocre middle-class Elon Musk —who wants to hire such a guy? Who would wants to hire Musk as a worker, nobody! He just had to be the boss of his own company or he’d be sleeping under a bridge.I’d be curious to hear advice or if someone had similar experiences and found ways to overcome the typical INTJ problem of how you’re perceived; especially in an industry where there are no job interviews but it’s all networking, friends, attitude, booze and schmooze.",Underachieving: an INTJ’s torture

I’ve read countless articles on INTJs - pet peeves, typical behavioural patterns &amp; thought processes, the like, and I largely relate to those.And yet I don’t truly think I’m an INTJ. I’m highly open with my emotions; I don’t go to lengths to conceal them. I’m very prone to crying, and a good movie can easily earn my tears. I tend to be emotional at times, which clouds my judgement and my rationality, though thankfully I do calm down after a while and take a step back to evaluate my situation as objectively as I can. If that doesn’t work, I seek out my best friend, an INTP, and that usually does.I’m not entirely sure where I wanted to go with this post, but what I think I’m really asking is whether I’m truly the INTJ that tests say I am.

I often find these attachments stronger than what I consciously feel for most humans or pets in my life - although I recognize that as they are not sentient and cannot interact with me, part of it must be due to my ability to have full control over my feelings towards them.Does anyone else experience anything similar, as INTJs are thought to relate upon physical systems in the world through their Fi?

886,intj,"Hi everyone! Not sure if it is relevant, but I'm an INFJ.qThis is a long post, and any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. Some backstory as it is relevant:My sister is 4 years younger than me, currently in High School and loves animals. She has a knack and passion for horse riding, and despite her being quite young she has already rehabilitated a horse by herself. She has also recently picked up coding and 3D modeling, though she'll likely only keep that as a hobby.She has a hard time understanding emotions and appealing to it. She treats conversations as negotiations, and pieces of information people give up about themselves as possible bargaining chips for later. She keeps to herself as she sees no need in conversing with other humans about emotional issues, and is confused why we try and help her, or get her to communicate what she is feeling. With her current attitude towards life and relationships, she has let quite a few close friends go and the family is getting fed up with her being aloof. I'm currently the only person she talks to, is willing to try understand her, figure out the root of her troubles and try drag her out of her pit of despair. Why I don't understand her:She can't treat conversations as it is. Everything has to be a negotiation going towards a certain outcome. As such she sees little regard in being pleasant when the conversation doesn't go the way she intended. How do I help her realize humans aren't just pawns waiting to be maneuvered to her desired outcome when she pleases? (this is an exaggeration, trying to get the picture across).When you bring up the topic of her being aloof and in a pit of despair, which is most likely self-inflicted, she shuts up and refuses to talk. Why can't she see that communicating could help her solve so many of her issues and allow those closest to her a better understanding of her predicaments? She also sees little need to apologize for when she is being curt. It's almost as if she refuses to acknowledge being wrong about something, or take responsibility for her actions. This is most likely her immaturity and age coming through (17), but wondering if it might be something any of you struggled with?Right now she just wants control over her life, even if it means dropping out of school. I get that, almost everyone in their adolescent stage craved more independence, but why risk jeopardizing your life over something you'll likely achieve in 2 years time? She has a few job offers when she graduates, mostly equestrian related jobs, she is willing to let this go as well. Any idea how I can help spark that passion again for her? She isn't riding anymore, but I know she wants to and would love to follow her passion. My guess is that it's a thing of spite when looking at her need for control. Oh, and she struggles with picturing the steps to a goal. She only sees an end goal (I will master 3D modeling by October, I will code a game and do all the art in a years with no help or prior knowledge of game development, etc.). Apparently this is a recurring theme with INTJ, any advice for an outsider trying to help her understand it a bit better?","INTJ sister, struggling to understand her"

Mine came by way of outside brute force pushing it to the front of my thoughts and existence. I'm thankful for it, but it does bring about some amounts of pain and realization that is extremely uncomfortable. I'm reminded of things I've said and done that I had stored away in the dark corner labeled ""SHAME"" and periodically those things are dragged out and sifted through. I've gone through a stage of self-awareness and analysis and realized I dont entirely like the person I used to be. Not much at all, really. I was a prick, still can be but not by default. Selfishness guided most of my decisions, never thinking about the surrounding individuals or objects. I've left chaos behind me. The problem and the solution are the same though: I see it. Seeing it makes me question everything I've done, and everything I'll do. That ever present self doubt that makes us wonder if that's the decision that will get us where we want to be, or if that's just what we want presently. At the time it felt right, but this also feels right so what is right?? I've broken things and people, not often with the intention of doing so.

904,intj,"Hey everyone! So a really close girlfriend of mine (probably best friend and I are super close, hangout, share memories and give advice and support one another etc... we don’t have a competitive friendship like some women do as we truly want the other to thrive. Now for the past week I know she’s been under a lot of stress emotionally so I’ve been trying to support her, invite her over for wine nights. Cruise with music on etc and watch movies (all covid friendly activities), and I always feel like she’s appreciative but lately we were meant to meet up a few times this week and she’ll run late but fail to let me know. I don’t mean 5 mins late but like an hour late (?) The worst part about it is that she’ll tell me “I’m here” so I’ll make way and see that she’s not and/or she’ll say “on my way” and show up 40 mins later. Now the first time I let it slide but by the second I spoke up politely and said hey what’s up? Don’t do that cause it’s my time too and I would appreciate you not making me wait or at the least letting me know prior. She understood but didn’t really apologize and said “got it”. I’m not one to harbor bad feelings so I let it go. Fast forward she did it again yesterday and blamed it on “traffic”, to which I said fine but spoke up again and told her next time (again) just let me know.Today however was the final straw. We were meant to meet up and she told me “I have work sorry can we meet later?” Which was totally cool cause she communicated right? So I said yup all good and went about my day and told her I would do my thing and we can hang later. At that point it was 2ish. I went on a hike and around 4 she messaged me and I said hey! Almost done I’ll meet you at X place at 4:30? She’s like cool yup all good. At 4:30 I was about 5 mins away and my battery was about to die and so I told her hey meet me at this spot specifically my battery is dying and the message delivered but then my batt died. I got there and parked. Waited in the area. 5 mins. 10 mins. Nothing So I walked around twice and couldn’t find her and then saw her car around 5:40. I walk up to the car and she’s in it chilling and I go hey! I was at the spot we were meant to meet over the block and she goes “I don’t know I thought you meant here” to which I responded no... I was pretty clear. So she sulked, didn’t even apologize and semi ignored me too when I asked why she didn’t meet there and she goes “look I’m tired and hungry, I’m just gonna go” and so I started to really get irritated and told her “do you not care for my time at all?” And she kept looking the other way and I said “hello?” And she’s like “stop, people are looking”.... when she said that I kinda blew up and said ok well f people cause I care about my friendships more, and walked off. I texted her when I got home and charged my phone explaining that I was sorry for walking away but a b and c ... she hasn’t responded yet. Who’s wrong or right here? Am I mistaken in anyway?

I can easily point out mistakes when I am dancing and correct it.

I have no charisma at all and actually tend to put people off without doing anything, from my perspective at least.

930,intj,"Our personalities are determined by both our genes (nature) *and* the environment we grew up in (nurture). I'm wondering whether individuals are INTJs simply because of their DNA, or whether they had the same experiences in childhood that made them INTJs. If nurture plays a role, it means that we all have something in common. Maybe our parents had the same parenting style, or we went through an experience that made us develop some traits.For example, most INTJs don't like showing their emotions. Many of them think that showing them makes them weak. I suggest that each of us try to find a childhood experience that we think is responsible for this. So, choose a trait almost every INTJ has, or a behavior every INTJ engages in, and comment on this post your experience to see if we have a similar one. Also, I believe I and N are nature. T and J could be both nature and nurture. -**About me:**Growing up, I learned to be very independent. My mother always used to work all day, so I learned how to spend time alone and how to do things on my own, for example studying alone. Also, my mother isn't very emotional. Because of this, I never felt the need to express my feelings as a child, as I saw no point. My dad has NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder). He never really cared about me, and he was always out with his friends. Because my mother worked, he was the one who ought to take me outside to walk or play with other kids. However, he never did that. So I never learned to socialize before going to school, and I never found playing with other kids in parks exciting. If you know about parenting styles, my mother was permissive, and my dad neglecting, though sometimes acted authoritarian.When my mother wasn't working she was talking to me. We used to talk about my life from an early age. Some years later, when she wasn't working that much and I was about 9, my mom and I kept talking a lot. That may be responsible for the fact that I was more mature than other kids. And also, mom always treated me like an adult. That's all I can think of right now. They probably affect my T and J, and reinforce my I. I wonder if any of you relate. (Please write it if you have any doubt being INTJ, as it would be more accurate)",INTJ: Nature or Nurture?

947,intj,"I’m 23, male, and I’m a sucker for knowledge. Ever since high school I loved and enjoyed math, physics, biology, chemistry; anything that involves complex systems, and especially those that require problem solving. That second one is even more important. I spent a significant part of my high school years exploring crazy but fun ideas about physics and solving math problems and it was a high like a drug.After acing high school, and under passive social pressure, I applied for medicine and was accepted into medical school. I fell in love with the complexity of the human body and its systems. However, as the semesters rolled by, I started coming to the realization that this major is extremely memorization oriented. Now, every field requires rote memorization for its principles and laws, but this one blew my expectations out of the water. It didn’t matter how well you understand the system, you have to memorize the one and only correct and acceptable way for things and it started to bog me down. Now I don’t mind a challenge, and I enjoy discovering details within systems, but this major has required very minimum innovation and problem solving from me. The more I learn about how things work for a physician and the way our school operates, the more I realize that I’m studying to learn preprogrammed things that require little to no addition. Unless -of course- I go out of my way to go down the research route, but even if I did, I have nowhere near the right financial ground to go down research the way I want with the freedom I would want. I fantasize about being this great diagnostician who solves cases and medical mysteries, not a 9 to 5 worker following protocol.I’m in my fifth year, and my medical school has failed to make me think. All it did was make me memorize. I’ve done all the thinking on my own. I find myself pushing and forcing myself to find fun in studying by doing reading different sources and making diagrams and brain maps, but it’s like pushing a car up a hill with no engine. Then I discovered programming. I’ve started two months ago, with the guidance of a friend of mine who majored in computer science. And now I’m developing my own little 2D game from scratch and I’m loving every second of it. The problem solving, the pure logical thinking, the planning and building.. I haven’t  felt this high, since Highschool when I was doing math problems. But this one was even better, it included the thrill of creation. Of conceptualizing something, and then actually making it real! It combined the thrill I get from composing music or sketching or writing, with problem solving. It was -literally- everything my brain needed to be happy.I now find no problem with spending over 8 hours in one sitting trying to build an application solution, implementing a new feature, or heck, even designing a small program for the uni to help with a small task. It’s like heroine. The more I make the more I want to make.Now I ask myself.. was it the right decision to major in medicine? When theories and critical thinking and problem solving is what I really want to do?The rational part of me says yes, medical school provides a steady job, one that can support a family, and I can always do some other stuff on the side as a hobby. But the intuitive part of me keeps asking this one question: how much would I have achieved if I had pursued math, physics, or programming as a full time goal? How far would I have come?So tell me: am I irrational? Am I correct in questioning this? Did I make a mistake?","I’m second guessing my choice of study major, 5 years in.."

(to clarify: empathy for me isn't really too indicative of Fe, I still have shit Fe lol)The way you people portray yourselves as cold loners without a shrivel of emotion is beyond me. That's what keeps me from ever truly relating, even though I already feel like my personhood is being read the more I spend time on this sub. Yet, I feel like people are already telling me I'm mistyped.

962,intj,"Fellow INTJs and lurkers of other types. Have you ever given up on finding love?Being an introvert (21 M), I used to never really go out of my way to talk to people- especially the opposite sex, out of romantic interest. But for a long time there has been a sense of loneliness, or a void as I call it, inside myself.Most people who give advice say things like “stop focusing on that and go find your purpose” or “work on other areas of your life”. I did that, and continue to improve the quality of my life in every way. But even then, there’s a longing within me. There are bottled up feelings of adoration that have no fixed person to be directed towards.I know I have a lot to share with someone, and I have confidence in myself that I’d make a great partner. But every single person I’ve met in recent times just ended up disappointing me. And before you say my standards might be too high, they aren’t. I have a clear idea of my own self worth and what I deserve. Yet the more new people I meet, the more I feel like giving up.I’ve always been intrigued with the idea of romance and adoring, protecting and sharing my life with another person. But in actively looking for it, I just keep losing that spark. I know people just won’t waltz into my life so easily, I don’t like to rely on luck. To be completely honest, I’m afraid of going into my late 20s and even 30s without experiencing something that lasts.Any advice you have for this fed up INTJ? You’re welcome to share your thoughts too if you relate. Thanks.",The death of romance
963,intj,"It's said that INTJs make few emotional attachments, but when they do, they fall in love deeply and intensely. And so they may end up hung up on someone they loved silently but endlessly, even long after it's over. However unlike some F types, INTJs are more likely to keep it silently locked up deep inside themselves and come back to privately dwell on it, while the F types are more likely to act on it by contacting the person, or talking about their feelings to others.Anyone else still silently but hopelessly in love with someone they can't be with, months or years later?","Anyone else still secretly and silently hung up on someone they loved, years later?"

I’m constantly having a conversation in my head that is generally louder than the one taking place real time. I plan almost EVERYTHING. Then I don’t adapt well when the world doesn’t adhere to my plan. There are many things that make me believe I am an INTJ. Including every MB test result.However, not really one person who I am close with considers me to be introverted. (Let me ask my boyfriend again when he gets home.. he hates talking this personality stuff with me because I go full INTJ on it.. so I avoid the topic)ANYWAYS.I’ve only taken the MB test since I’ve been a full time “stoner”. I don’t mean a few doobies at night, I mean 4 years of smoking bongs from the minute I wake up, all throughout the day, until I sleep. I was a loud, rowdy kid and if you looked at me from a glance, I’ve never seemed an “introvert”.But nowadays, I really pride myself on thinking before I speak, and I really value the constant conversation I’m having inside my own head, I truly believe it helps me, in most occasions, make the best decisions for myself. I’m genuinely worried that smoking weed aids this function, and that if I stop smoking consistently that I will lose my introvert self which I cherish so dearly. She always looks out for both of us and keeps us in check.

But when I wake up I remember every detail and I feel like: ""What was all that and what do they mean? They were so strange and felt so real.""

985,intj,"Literally what the subject line says. 1. I've never felt remorse for hurting anyone. But I do feel an ethical dissonance, as if I've violated one of my rules -- by which I also judge others. I dislike feeling like a hypocrite since I don't like hypocrites. Still, there's no emotional response on my behalf that could be akin to guilt.2. I feel tenderness towards cute things. I was traumatized as a kid, i.e. beaten for punishment and also when my mother wasn't happy (started at age 4), constantly criticized as a person for every little thing I did ""wrong"", ""disowned"" a few times starting at age 10, when I was shoved out in the snow in my nightgown, observed conflict between adults, grew up mostly with just one parent, but still had happy memories and had access to education, food and clothes at all times. But I'm almost abnormally childlike when I allow myself to be -- I have strong attachments to my stuffed animals and can enjoy watching Winnie-the-Pooh. 3. I'm not impulsive when it comes to the big things -- I am considered very responsible at my workplace and with my family responsibilities (younger siblings). When I need to ""disappear"" for a few weeks of alone time, I let people know ahead of time. During these bouts of ""alone time"", I feel no need to connect with anyone, and spend my time reading, watching operas, practicing instruments, etc. I feel strongly about my work and feel a moral responsibility to do it not just for the money, but for intellectual fulfillment and for being useful to this world in some way. But at the same time the idea of never becoming someone ""significant"" hurts me -- I don't mean fame, which I find a very stressful notion.4. I manipulate without consciously trying to manipulate. It's almost as if I am always trying to get a response out of someone. I exaggerate things about myself without feeling as if I'm lying, and ""fish for compliments"" without consciously intending to do so.5. Friendships have a) mostly not existed throughout my life, and b) felt more like means of entertainment or practical mutual assistance. I'll admit that I'm judgmental and will think of certain people as not thinking for themselves -- ""mindless"", in other words, although I try not to. This in particular also makes me feel like a hypocrite, although on most days it doesn't bother me as I don't think of it. I do feel a sense of superiority at times, although as with my judgmental traits I try to suppress it. 6. I don't really have one fixed personality. There are a few ""masks"" I put on depending on the situation or the person, but I do this subconsciously, only realizing after the fact. Still, I'm considered socially awkward. 7. I am capable of blaming myself, but generally only when I fail to achieve something, and then usually less for a lack of intrinsic ability as for laziness or procrastination.8. I develop strong obsessions with subjects, ideas, or people that tend to last only for a time. I seldom revisit these obsessions. The people obsessions only happen once every 2 years or so, and no one is followed or hurt, but online stalking does occur. This never happens out of a sexual desire, but moreover out of a desire to probe someone's mind, to get to think with them rather than of them. This desire has never been fulfilled. To that end, perhaps I do feel loneliness.9. Given these obsessions, I spend the vast majority of my time detached from the real world. This isn't a physical detachment as much as a mental one, as I still like to eat well, sleep, and engage in other pleasurable aspects of being human -- just alone. 10. If this helps, I'm an 18-year-old bi woman.Sorry for the TL;DR. Just wanted to ask, since I don't seem to be fully functional. Thanks.",What's wrong with me? Psychopath? Sociopath? Narcissist?

I appreciate his kindness, innovativeness, energy, the fact that he doesn't pressure me, the fact that he incorporates me into his family, friends circle, projects, etc.  I do struggle with certain things, though, and am hoping to get good advice here.  I know part of my struggle is based in my own worries from growing up with a passive aggressive parent, and from having been in relationships with passive aggressive people.  (They say they are not mad, but they are.  They do this but their motivation is really that. Etc.).  I am working on myself, and trying not to ascribe past experiences to him.  I want to be the best girlfriend I can be.  But I am not sure how to think/respond/relate sometimes--especially when he is very quiet.  We are both somewhat awkward when it comes to expressing our feelings.  Sometimes I do not know at all what he is thinking or feeling and it makes me nervous.  I try not to tell myself stories in my head, you know?  This relationship is the healthiest and happiest I have ever had.  We are planning to move in together in a few months.  It is very worth it to me to not eff it up.I know every person is unique.  But if any INTJ's would care to help me with the following questions (just what you would think), it would be much appreciated.  1) When you are in a bad mood about something not related to me, what should I do/not do to make it better?  Or at least not irritate you further?  How do I distinguish between ""you are just being quiet, in your head"" and ""you do not want to talk?"" 2) When you are angry with me about something, and I have acknowledged and apologized but feel that you are still giving me the cold shoulder, what should I do? 3) When I am feeling insecure and secretly want to ask you (again) for relationship reassurance, but don't want to appear so needy, what should I do? 4) When you have (in your mind) answered a question or ended a conversation, but I feel that things were left unsaid (on my end or both ends)...but I know if I keep talking about it I will irritate you...what should I do?  (It causes me to feel angry internally for not being heard or feeling I am not taken seriously).5) It seems to me that you leave many things unsaid.  Does this mean you do not fully trust me? 6) If there is anything else I should know in order to be the best partner to you possible, what would that/those thing(s) be?

1001,intj,"Hey all, I need some important advice from like-minded people here, preferably female so I can understand the perspectives from the other side.I got a match with an INTJ female on a dating app last week (we're both mid-20s). It's Hinge, so the probability of people being on there to find a meaningful relationship is higher (compared to just flings). I began messaging first and asking all the questions, pushing the conversation along (as required from males when dating). At that point I had no idea she's an INTJ although I knew she was an introvert. I touched on every info she had on her profile, and through convo I realised that our interests align extremely well. We chatted for a week and yesterday I got to have a video chat with her.  We both found out we were INTJs then. I'm seeking advice on what I should do next, or if there's no point in proceeding.Here's the important bit - I have zero idea of dating and romance in general. I know the general strategy of chatting about common interests and what not. However I have always been terrible with the wording when it comes to messages and usually come off as blunt or the recipient perceiving a message a different way that intended (which I assume many of you INTJs can relate to). As such I've consulted with my close group of friends each time before I perform an action. Every message has been perfectly crafted to hit every common interest we have. I myself have also timed my messages so I dont reply immediately to her responses (which might show I'm too desperate/clingy). From my point of view, I've handled the conversation just about perfectly. The only drawback is that my messages come off as ultra-mechanical - friends have said my messages feel too forced, artificial, and robotic. I don't deny it. Their advice is to ""be myself"" and act more natural, but I feel I am being somewhat myself by sending carefully considered messages to achieve the result I seek.Here's where it stands as of now - I think the video call went really well, we played some traditional board games online as well as pictionary (video games bein ga common interest) and chatted as well. In the call she mentioned we could play a different game next time and tentatively agreed on Wednesday evenings (our country is in lockdown due to the pandemic so we won't be able to meet at least for another month). When the call ended, I sent a message (crafted w friends) an hour later (again timed because I don't think you should reply immediately).&amp;#x200B;&gt;M (Me): ""Hey I had good fun, looking forward to the next time! Nice finally getting to meet you. Clearly I have to practice my drawing skills for the next time, yours looks good... But you looked even better ;)""  &gt;  &gt;M: ""Good night!""  &gt;  &gt;F: ""Lol my drawing of an ant was outstanding""  &gt;  &gt;F: ""Was good to meet you too!""&amp;#x200B;I gave her a compliment/flirt to steer this into a romantic path rather than the friendzone route. Of course ""beautiful"" is too cringe and I considered that a female INTJ wouldn't be too receptive to that, hence me and my friends came up with the above instead. With all of my actions, I believe it's clear to her that I'm interested/attracted to her. The problem is that my friends noticed her response was a bit lacking, and normally someone would say thanks to a compliment or something.I theorise:1. It was past midnight, and she might have abruptly woken up to my message, sent off a quick response in her groggy state, and went back to sleep.2. After the video call, she just wasn't attracted to me anymore. Our interests might align but she might not've felt a connection to me, or wasn't physically attracted to me, or (100+ reasons).&amp;#x200B;***QUESTION:***1. *Today is the day after the call. I believe I shouldn't send her a message today at all since she's an introvert and an INTJ and we all need some time alone. I was thinking of sending a message tomorrow instead, but my friends advised me that somebody not sending a message the day after a date (though this was virtual) would be the equivalent of implying I'm no longer interested in her after the video call and would ruin all the efforts I've put in so far - the equivalent of suicide.*2. *Female INTJs - How can I reliably tell if she's interested in me still after the call? In our entire conversation, I've always been the one messaging first and driving discussion on topics forward. Granted it's the male's responsibility, but at some point in time I was hoping she'd message first to indicate her interest in me still. I feel like she's losing/has lost interest in me, and if so I wished she'd just tell me instead so we can both stop wasting each other's time.*P.S.: I am terribly sorry for the length of this post, especially as my first in this subreddit. I've just been overthinking so much over everything that my brain is melting. It's hard for INTJs to find someone they're attracted to both in appearance and intellect and I fear if I mess this up I won't find another one for years.

1007,intj,"I had a session with a therapist a few months back and to be honest I got absolutely nothing out of it. I went mainly because an ex (5 year relationship) had recently resurfaced in my life in a big way and stirred up some emotions I thought I had buried long ago. My work offers a free counselling service even for non-work related issues, so I thought I'd give it a try.It was over video call and was basically me talking to her about the ins and outs of what had happened with me and my ex. Now I expected I'd have to spend some time talking about that stuff, but I also expected some sort of advice or guidance back from her too. Instead I got nothing. I think the best tidbit of advice she had for me was when I was talking about how I dealt with things after our initial breakup, and I said how I'd just try and think of something else, something positive, and my mind would quickly move on. And she said yes, that seems like a good strategy you could use again now... Well yes, and I have been, but it's not a solution, it's a band aid that deals with the symptom not the cause.Yes, that pretty much sums up what I gleaned from the session. Then at the 50 minute mark she says ""whelp, that's it for this session. If you'd like to book another session please call the same hotline number blah blah blah"". I was shocked. I was at least expecting maybe for the last 5 minutes she would do some talking and offer some insight. But no, I just spent 50 minutes talking about uncomfortable shit, especially in front of a complete stranger, all for nothing. I didn't make a second booking.Is this what it is supposed to be like? I see/hear lots of other people say therapy is great, but I got nothing out of it. Did I just get a bad therapist? Maybe the work sponsored ones are generally unsuitable because they're used to dealing with work related issues? Did I need to attend more sessions before it becomes worthwhile?

Unless a large sample was rigorously tested and things like mental illness were considered then I have a hard time accepting stuff about INFJs and INTJ being like ultra rare pokemon. Data from test results and polls wouldn't be reliable either because of the self selected sampling and biases of the participant. Besides, if intuitives are more likely to be interested in MBTI then there should be over representation in the sample and we would expect a higher % of N types. If the percentages are estimates based on theory then I don't understand why some people take them so seriously. The bile on 16personalities and in some places on YouTube exist to stroke people's egos. There are too many confounding variables to get measurements of ""rarity"" so why do ""INFJs"" and ""INTJs"" insist they're rare?If anyone knows how these things are measured and where 16p gets 2% of the population and 0.8% of women.

1026,intj,"**PSA**:  All being an INTJ describes is your starting position. It is not a prescription to be an a-hole. Not a lot of INTJs I know in the real world. Looking for more, come to reddit. Why not?, the internet is a great place for people to find like minded individuals. Find and surf the INTJ subreddit and it's all about stereotypical nonsense that a quick Google can provide. ""I'm unemotional, people get angry when I speak the truth, etc."". I'd be interested to know the statistics of how many folks are only pretending / wishing they were INTJ and using Google to fake the part. It doesn't matter, I'm just naturally curious.Anyway - **INTJ isn't a box to live in. It's a starting point, and like all starting points it's not the place you should still be at when the journey ends**. My free advice, feel free to ignore, is to read on the INTJ for informational purposes, to get a baseline of your likely strengths and weaknesses, then go fix them. Example:  I scored very high in the introverted space, but my job requires I lead project teams. I practiced, forced myself to step out of my comfort zone, and kept seeking feedback to gauge progress. Now I can hold my own facilitating large groups, and when I'm done I default back to my introverted nature and go to my room to recharge.As humans we possess both introverted and extroverted genes.

1047,intj,"Just like many kids, my parents were making me believe in Santa. But I always knew it is impossible because of the obvious inconsistencies - like that, if he gave presents to all the billions of children in the world (yes, I knew the then world population), he would spend less than a millisecond to each house, yet some people claimed they have seen him, which requires at least several seconds. Also we had no chimney, our door was constantly locked, there were no flying raindeers, and so on. But every time I raised these arguments and said Santa is impossible, my parents used to say ""I don't know."", tell me it works in some magical incomprehensible way, or ask me how is it impossible when Santa is the one that brought me the presents the previous year. And everyone else I asked would tell me he is real. So I  either had to accept the obvious insanity of Santa being real, either had to accept that everyone I ever met was lying to me about some unimportant for him/her thing for no reason. The latter was some conspiracy at the level of the simulated reality conspiracy or the Truman syndrome. And this continued for way too many years. I was getting psychotic because I had to choose one of two obviously impossible things. At some point I was questioning reality.And there are still some people who justify that lie. They say it is nice and cute for children to believe in something impossible if it makes them feel good. This is supposed to be a white lie. But the same kind of ""*white*"" lie can be ""*justified*"" for adults too, in situations where it's obviously not justified. Like when your girlfriend/boyfriend has cheated on you but doesn't tell you so you don't feel bad. Or any kind of propaganda lies. And in most cases it's not even a ""*white*"" lie, because parents fear confronting their child for the fraud they have done, so that changes their motives from altruistic to egoistic.So when I was 10 and I for the nth time asked my mother whether Santa is real, she finally said no. Then I asked her why had they been lying to me for so long and she simply said I had been too young. That was the most disrespectful and humiliating moment in my life.I am posting that here because I honestly don't know where to post it.

I've kind of always felt this way, like I can't relate to most people, like I don't belong anywhere. I was bored in school, because I learned the material quicker than most of my peers, so I turned to secretly writing stories because it looked close enough to note taking. When the other kids played on the playground, I would sit on the blacktop and write, or sometimes read. In high school, I had no desire to go to parties or get drunk or have sex (honestly, I was later in the game of romantic/sexual attraction than anyone else I knew; I never had those 5th grade ""boyfriends"" all my friends had, nor did I want one, and wasn't even remotely interested in sex until I was 18. I've had maybe 6 or 7 crushes in my entire life, including serious and not-so-serious, which felt isolating all the time. I didn't have my first crush until I was 14).Long story short, I'm 21 now, I graduated college early, got a full time job as the youngest person at my company at 19, moved out on my own completely. I enjoy living alone and having this independence but it's only furthered my feeling of just being isolated or just like no one really understands me (this sounds so emo lol, I don't know how to phrase this properly though). All of my friends are still full time students living at home. They don't have jobs, they don't have bills; they have curfews and complain to me about their siblings and parents, and meanwhile my qualms are more along the lines of worrying about work and rent and other things. More than ever, I feel a lot older than anyone my age.Most of my coworkers are in their 30s and up. I relate to them a little more, but a lot of them have kids and whatnot and there's a generational gap too, obviously.So I sort of feel as though I have no peers, which is how I felt all my life, it's just been magnified the past few years.

I did this recently while watching the Dark Knight Trilogy and The Witcher Netflix series, for example, where after every conversation I would rewind to ensure I’d heard every single word and knew exactly what was going on, even pausing to look up words I maybe didn’t know or names which I did not recognise, even sometimes when the point was that I wasn’t meant to know who the person was at that point.I hate it in a way, because it totally disconnects me from the story itself. I think it’s partly because the way my brain works I constantly have so many thoughts racing through my head that I try to focus on the words being said, that they just lose all significance to me and it’s just... words... then I need to rewind because I just repeated meaningless words in my head and they lost all meaning. Furthermore, I then begin doubting my cognitive capabilities since I need to take so much time to understand a plot and characters, but at the same time I wonder if it’s just down to my analysing nature that I need to know every tiny detail so keep going over individual scenes to dissect words and phrases to pick apart implications and points in a story where a normal person would take it at face value.I feel like I can’t even express it properly through text, but I hope you know what I mean. I guess I just want to know if this is to do with my being an INTJ, constantly going back to and analysing tiny details in insignificant scenes because I just *need* to know what’s actually going on or being said at that point. There’s also a few personal reasons why i could be seeing things in such an overwhelming manner - I’m in my last year of high school right now, trying to decide my next move in education, doing online classes where I may or may not be doing my final tests, so I have a lot going on and a lot of uncertainty in my head at the moment too regarding myself and my future, so it’s pretty hard for me to switch off as it is.My minds just so crowded with simple things - video games I want to complete, movies I want to watch, series I want to watch, YouTube videos I want to watch, not to forget the constant shadow of school and a responsibility to myself to ensure I maintain my education and intelligence, and I’m trying to balance all this with trying to maintain somewhat of a social life, sacrificing time I’d otherwise be putting towards crossing things off the ‘list’ of things I actually want to do as listed above to instead do something I’d be happy enough without doing.So yeah, do you understand what I’m getting at and if so do you see this as more down to my analysing/critical nature in that I tend to fully think through and dissect every little thing I come across or experience, or could it potentially just be to the personal events in my life right now sort of piling on top of each other?",Way too analytical for my own good?

I love to talk about emotions and thoughts and feel a great need to share them with my close friends. Sometimes, I don’t know when to stop arguing. Usually when I’m told ‘no’ and is something I was planning on doing. Another thing, I hate boring work and tend to daydream and talk to myself like an INFP. My peers would say I’m optimistic though INTJs usually aren’t. I know this might just be a rant and stupid. Though, I’m curious to know if other people are like this or is it just one of those me things. I want to know if I just broke the system and have no personality. I’m pretty boy obsessed and it’s a common thing I talk about with my ENFP best friend. I’m pretty forgetful and clumsy. I could keep going all day how I don’t fit in, but can anyone help me?

1066,intj,"To be more specific, falling in love with one intj that doesn't have the same feeling for me is the hardest thing I've done ever.  Hello my fellow intjs, I am a 25 year old ENTP(female) and recently feel like living in the hell. And yes, I fell in love with an intj (male) . We've known each other for more than one year and are exclusive fwb (does this really exists). At first, it is just like, and I am very confident that I could manage that. To be honest, I am always someone who could detach very quickly. But with all the good/deep conversations, laughs and happiness that we had, one day I just suddenly realized that I love him. And at the instant, I know he wouldn't feel the same way because he never fell in love with anyone and think fwb is the best choice. I was an idiot as a first time fall in love person, I thought even though he doesnt feel the same way, it is fine. He is so intelligent, funny and cold outside but sweet and kind inside, so I chose to stay with him and  let myself falling and falling.But things are not as easy as naive old me thought. Falling in love with someone who doesn't love you back makes you doubt yourself. Maybe because I am not beautiful, because I am not funny enough and so on. And I lost my happiness. One night, I just told him anyways. He was a little surprise because I told him I also never loved anyone before. He said he appreciate that and I am the first person who truly love him except his family and it is a really nice experience and also he loves but in a different way. Although I knew his answer long before, but actually heard it is so much pain. Recently Im gonna move to another country and might never come back. I am so sad that I am leaving him and cried a lot a lot. Realizing he also does't feel the same kind of sad makes me feel even more sad and pathetic. Today with all these tears, I suddenly realized I should give up our relationship long time ago. Love is not something you could pay lots of  efforts to gain, even though you tried so hard to stay in his country, remember to buy his favorite snacks every time you met him because you just want him to be happy...If he doesn't feel the same way, he might even not noticed all the efforts you paid.

Just to keep in mind.Understanding patterns, ""sensing"" the future, having insight on how people think... sometimes it's too much. Especially when (and I'm not trying to sound all ~so different and smart~) most people I know don't understand or care. The other day my friend got me a ""surprise gift"" and I wasn't surprised. At all. I knew, off of next to nothing, she was getting me a gift and what it was. I didn't tell her I wasn't surprised, but it bugged me.I've taken note of and studied human behavior most of my life- being so aware of how people are likely to act/why people do the smallest things- sometimes it's irksome. And not even in a ""oh, this person has mistreated me, but I understand their pain and can't be mad"" way, though that does happen. But more in an ""all this information I can't even use or talk about just knocking around my head""I think far too much and didn't even realize it until yesterday. I was talking to my sister, having an off day, trying to function. I asked her why I was struggling and she told me I was stressed. I told her ""I don't feel stressed, I don't understand, why?"" (or something to that affect) She said ""You think too much,"" and I started explaining why I may or may not think too much and what it felt like and--- she just simply said ""literally look how much you just thought about the idea you might think too much.""It's hard to understand certain things about yourself when they are how you've always been.

1099,intj," Hi,this weekend I had a girl over which I have been seeing for about a month. From the first moment I knew I like her, I wont describe that in more detail, as it is not important, but I really do. On Saturday we had some deep talk and she talked more about herself and about us when we first started seeing each other. To make the long story short, she has some mental problems related to feeling worthless and insecure, she told me a lot of scenarios she came up with and went through with her friends regarding us. From this I could say she really liked me, if what she said was true. In the evening, when we talked more deeply she said, that at one point she wanted to stop texting me, as she felt like she is just not good enough for me, that I deserve someone better, but could not. I asked her to simply answer whether she wants to be with me and she said very quickly ""yes, of course I want to be with you"", after that we both said we love each other. The next morning we cuddled for like 3 hours in bed, she said she did not want to let go of me as she knows we wont see each other for another week. We had great sex afterwards.The problem is, I read on some red pill and relationship subreddit that women always say this when they want to get rid of you, but don't want to hurt your feeling, but I hope in this context in might be different. Also her texting pattern changed, she usually hates texting, but todays has been replying a lot quicker with more in depth information.So in the end, do you think it is really possible she loves me ? What do I do here, should I be there for her, or will being a supportive person ruin the relationship and the dynamic ? I want to let her know that I really view her and fully equal, and don't want her to feel that way, but I am worried that trying to do this will ruin the dynamic.Lastly, I am posting here mainly, because we are both INTJs, even though I cycle between ENTJ and INTJ and found another similar  post here. A lot of dating/relationship subreddits seems to be full of people which tent generalize out of context saying ""this always means she does not like you"" or ""you cant express so many feeling for her or you will become her dumping bag"".

I'm not going to do anything bad besides a lot of overthinking and obsessive planning for every possible situation I could possibly end up in, just like I always do (could be an INTJ thing, I suppose). This is not intended for a cry for help, I'm genuinely curious about your thoughts on this. I hope understanding your perspectives could inspire me to change some neural pathways and to be helpful for those who participate in the discussion.I've been having s\* ideations/thoughts for 3 years, having depression for longer. I believe the root of it (tho not the only reason) is out of me being dissociated from negative feelings since childhood. As a result, I neglected my feelings while making decisions, operated under what I thought of as logical and rational decisions. It made me feel in control, but also robot-liked and didn't believe much in free will (Since when emotion is out of the picture, there always exists an easy best choice for any multiple-choice question. Since we have limited information about the world, given what we know at the moment, the choices are always enumerable, thus the multiple-choice question.). Only via depression, I discovered an emotional self, one that's malfunctioned, not fulfilled.I strongly believed in neuroplasticity, it's never too late to become someone you would like to be. But what if for me, the reward along the way will not outweigh the effort it takes to change the wiring of the brain (and an imagined relief obtained from s\*). What if my logical self and emotional self come to the same conclusion to end this at some point.Sounds like I'm afraid of the future (for you reading: this uncertainty is supposed to also bring excitement and opportunities and positive changes), yes, because I'm afraid to feel extremely lonely forever and it's an inevitable curse to be human. And would be extra hard when you feel like a misfit.Thank you, I appreciate you spending your time and intention for reading (as they are the most valuable one can give). Especially when you have so much on your shoulder, that makes you so loveable.

Time and time again I thought we clicked, but they would say otherwise, playing the ""good guy"" card. I know romance isn't my thing, I can't seem to get hearts to flutter, only brains to tink.  But anyways, I have tried staying as friends to one or two of them but eventually cutting off contact cause I just feel like a fool for sticking around.

1123,intj,"So I am currently studying psychology, freshman year, and the MBTI was discussed in the 101 class. The lecturer said that *the MBTI is not that scientific* and should not be taken too seriously. However, I find it very useful because I can categorize people around me and find the most efficient way to deal with them based on their MBTI.I just had a conversation with another INTJ about this and she told me that what I am doing is a classic INTJ behavior lol.",Did you also get into this MBTI thing because you like to categorize people around you and find the most efficient way to deal with them?

1125,intj,"I am posting this here because you guys always have the best advice for INFPs and I feel like you can really understand and see our weaknesses and blind spots.  I’m a 24 year old female INFP (enneagram 4). I like to read and I read a lot (but could do more, of course), mostly poetry and nonfiction on topics that interest me (usually “soft” subjects like literature, philosophy, psychology, etc.). I like films and music too and spend time absorbed in them.Despite the fact that I would describe myself as bookish and thoughtful and even intellectual, I’m coming to realize that I’m just not very smart. It’s  pretty demoralizing. Honestly, most people, I think,  assume I’m somewhat slow and stupid, incompetent at the very least, and easy to manipulate. I was told by my friends I would be the most likely to join a cult. You know how some people are just “smart as a whip” and very witty and articulate and mature. Well I’m the opposite of that. When I talk about my ideas they don’t really make sense or sounds very good to others. I don’t know a lot of general knowledge even basic things, and even when I learn them, I can’t remember stuff about US history or geography or just the world at large. That stuff can probably just be fixed by practicing but there are other things. For instance, I am bad at following movies and even conversations. I don’t know what’s going on a lot and when all of my friends can predict what’s going to happen I am amazed and frustrated by my inability to participate. I am horrible at almost every group activity, be it a puzzle or a game of cards, I feel like I’m nearly always the worst one. I always say stupid things and get things VERY wrong about history or world affairs. People are generally nice to me but I have been teased on occasion for being stupid and an airhead. Sometimes people are amazed at how stupid I can be. I am known as “spacey.” I have ADD but I’m medicated. I have other good qualities and I know I can develop those but I actually really value intelligence. I watch Ted talks and read scholarly articles in my free time. I love intellectual conversations. Yet I’m still stupid. I guess I shouldn’t let it get to me but it does. This post is full of thoughts I’ve been having for a long time but was triggered by a really embarrassing trivia night experience.There are a lot of flaws I just embrace but this one really hurts me. Are there specific things I can do? any advice? I feel like I’m always the stupid friend.Also, if I can’t really do anything to become more intelligent or to seem more intelligent (besides just not talking) how can I reframe this or cope with not being smart? P.S. I know there are multiple intelligences and such, but for the sake of this post, I think you know what I mean.

As a first world, middle-class 20 year old with decent genes and a ""good head on my shoulders"", I should be capable of whatever I set my mind to. I've treated myself as if I were a video game character, and I've been min/maxing my stats because I wanted to turn myself into the best person that I could be. Thinking of things in this manner made productivity one of my strong suits. Getting myself up to go to the gym, for example, wasn't a choice fueled by motivation. It was something I always did because I knew it would make me better in some way.  But lately? This past year or so, and especially these last few months, I've had an incredibly hard time continuing on this way. Depression has hit a hell of a lot harder than I expected, and my discipline has fallen to the wayside. Everything outside of my room fills me with anxiety and leaves me wondering ""what's the point?""  Over this winter break, I had a plan to be productive and get something tangible done. Instead, I've been binge watching anime and playing video games, staying up until 6AM and ignoring the world outside. I'm already sick of living like this, but I can't seem to muster up the energy to snap out of it. I don't know how this happened. Maybe it was the fact that I've spent yet another holiday alone? Maybe it was the breakup I had earlier this year. I've always thought I was above that kind of thing. I never considered myself to be the type of person whose mood could be ruined by worldly matters.  But that's where I am.

1140,intj,"Hey fellow INTJs - Someone posted as a comment a while back that INTJs hate details, which really got me thinking which spiraled into self-reflection. Posting this mostly for discussion, but also curious to know how people have gotten better at what I’m calling “mid-level” thinking.I actually really like details. I don’t care for tedium, but I do like micro-level thinking and details within a system.I also really like high-level thinking and exploring how to create systems and processes and playing around with different concepts at a macro-level.Where I struggle is taking that macro concept and turning it into micro. I can outline an entire process. And I can provide incredible details on processes that have been created. But that mid-range switch is hard.Here’s an example. I can outline the most efficient, step-by-step way to make a sandwich. 1. Slice bread. 2. Spread condiments. Etc etc. And when I have all the ingredients in front of me, I can follow step by step and make that sandwich no problem. But in picking out ingredients: what’s the best bread? What’s the best cheese? What’s the best....?

1193,intj,"Though this is just my opinion through my own personal experience, I see all the time online that ENFP's are the ones best suited for INTJ relationships however I noticed conflicting opinions that ENFP's are way too flighty, too hyper, too chameleon-like etc. This was confirmed when I dated an ENFP for a short time. While she was everything I could have asked for initially, and the conversation was absolutely remarkable due to her creativity -- I began looking at the bigger picture and focused on what qualities I would need for happiness and growth in the long-term.I then met a few INFP's and I am now completely convinced that INFP's are in fact the true MBTI match for an INTJ. It makes sense, they are way more calm and collected, deeper, thoughtful and considerate of your opinion and share most of the qualities of an ENFP but just projected inwardly. I feel due to the extroverted nature of the ENFP they are able to sing and broadcast their qualities a lot more and that's why they get all the attention. Hence all the Youtube, reddit posts etc about this apparent dream match. They are simply out-shining the INFP's, because that's what they do and are extremely good at.So it appears to me that while ENFP's are indeed a good match at first sight, and don't get me wrong I'm sure there are plenty of healthy, happy INTJ-ENFP relationships and if they work then it would be extremely blissful I'm sure...BUT, if you're still a single, stable, chill INTJ -- try find an INFP and give them a shot, you may be surprised...NOTE: INFP's will be much, much more difficult than finding an ENFP, but hey, ya gotta put in the effort.","The unsung hero, INFP's vs ENFP's for INTJ relationships?"

And we laugh on stuff together. We just understand each other And everytime, we discovered more stuff about each other that made things more interesting. The charisma was undeniable.However, being an INTJ doesn't mean that the person doesn't have psychological problems. Claiming that she was in a narcissistic family and had an abusive father was a big red flag to me. A lot of people who had such rough childhood tend to exude the traits they dealt with in the unhealthy household. All stems from negative experiences such as Abandonment, stonewalling, etc.All I had to do is to back off a little bit to test my theory and damn was I right!She just ghosted me right away. All I did was just back off a little bit to see how she will react. She texted me that I haven't talked to her since our last date -which was 3 days ago- and that I came across her mind. I simply replied that I was busy with my band writing music and that I missed her and I would love to see her.

1200,intj,"Fellow INTJs! Could you please help in typing me...?  Am I an INTJ or INTP (or neither...)? Can anyone tell?  I initially thought I was an INTP.  INTP was great, I thought ""Oh my gosh finally, I actually found my type"", and it made me feel proud and like I could finally relax on trying to research types endlessly to find the right one. This was it. It took SO long for me to finally come to a conclusion, I was glad to be done with it so I could move on and feel confident in relaying my MBTI identity.But then, as I always do, I never stop researching and pursuing my urge to confirm or deny my suspicions over and over again. Because I can never just leave a new good thing I've found that works alone until I've analyzed from every single perspective and angle and relation possible (which is literally endless) to make sure it's just 100% perfect. Spoiler alert, I never get to that conclusion that it's perfect.  So I continued to exhaust every single resource I could find, over and over again throughout multiple days, to just make sure that that LITTLE inkling of curiosity ""what if I'm not this type/Am I for SURE this type, though?"" was satisfied.   Then I really delved into INTJ and I had a way more powerful eureka than I did with even INTP. It was absolute GIDDYness, it was empowering, it was relieving, it was finally being understood by myself and the world. It clicked, it connected, it resonated... I could almost cry at how much every little detail resonated! I couldn't stop smiling that night.  Then the next morning, I had to go over ALL of my findings again, checking even more new resources, insisting that I make sure my typing was FLAWLESSLY accurate. It was for sure either between INTP or INTJ, I just had to be certain which it truly was. I still have doubts/concerns that maybe I'm still directing myself in the wrong direction and that maybe I'm not either of those, but I really feel like I am. And if I'd felt such resonance before, that has to mean something, right? I keep trying to tell myself that it does, yet I can't help but dismiss it.  Again, as I always do, I started to doubt myself and my feelings as I read more and more. Certain things lost their clarity as I searched and searched my experiences and what fit to what I was reading.  Every single day, I seem to look at things from a different point of view, or rather I consult a different method of perceiving and reasoning with my feelings each time, and I really do feel like it does me worse than good. Not one, not ONE, thing in my personal life feels like I have my act straight in.  I can't stop thinking about what may or may not be real for me and what my case would look like to others if they examined it, just trying to compare everything for that one definitive result.  Now, what felt so right just the day before, predictably, lost its' passion to the what-ifs.  I even read this whole guide for INTJs, and several glorious INTJ tips for way of life, and I felt so good. I felt like I finally had direction and knew how to once and for all improve the stasis of my life and mental health, and then I lost it like I always do.  I went down the rabbit hole of endless self-analyzing and criticism on my experiences, trying to find proof *not* that I'm an INTP, but that I'm not *INTJ*.  I keep thinking, oh maybe this INTP thing vs this INTJ thing is right about me after all, not the other way around, even though just last night I thought the exact opposite thing with much more confidence and gusto.  But then, I read about the ways of cognition for INTP, and it literally makes me feel almost queasy. I feel so viscerally uneased and anxious. The way their feeling plays more of a part than an INTJ is what I feel like I've actually kinda done in a lot of my life to try and please others, and that's exactly what I've been trying to escape. It's never felt right to me, and it's caused me so much grief and damage, thus I've come to identify it as a great issue in my life that I've known needed to be resolved. Does that mean I'm not INTP, then, or?  Like the ways INTJ does things; Thinking of the whole picture and the way things systems of everything react, not having to worry about feeling and just being allowed to be objective, making routines and plans, all sound and felt EXACTLY like the assertive guidance I've been looking for.  I don't feel I'm good at some of those things, but it feels like I'd be capable of them if I just get comfortable with them, since I've never done those things for what feels like more out of lack of direction and self-confidence than lack of ability.  I've always tried to deny myself and every way I think or feel, so it just feels like I've damaged my clarity on how to be what I truly am and put the skills an INTJ typing has to use. I could heal it over time, and I want to try the tips because it felt right, but now that I'm worried again on if I'm an INTP instead, I've pulled back and feel completely stuck and hesitating on even wanting to at least TRY it before I knock it, because I worry it's somehow going to make my life worse if it ends up being NOT right for me because I'm truly an INTP, and/or maybe I'm equally concerned that I'd just be an imposter.  It feels like it'd help me so much, but what if it doesn't? What if I get there and it doesn't come as naturally to me as it does others? Or what if that'll NOW be the case now that I've doubted myself and am no longer as confident in it, like a self-fulfilling prophecy of self-sabotage?  I get myself to one finished piece of the puzzle that looks right, and then I find myself anxiously searching to make sure it's the right one and that I didn't just jam that one into place by mistake.",Am I INTJ or INTP?

I’d like to know your opinion about a situation I came across too many times.Sometimes, when I am bored, I like to express my opinion about various topics on the internet.I always start with a “thesis”.I am never aggressive as I enjoy sharing ideas with other people.I explain my point of view about a topic, then I explain why and I add some examples to make it clear.At this point, someone expresses their idea.Some people share their thoughts clearly (they rarely add proofs to validate their theories. I am not asking them to do it, I’d like them to, but I understand it may be too much for the internet) end up saying “everyone thinks differently”. And that’s all. Peacefully. But this is a rare situation. Only a small percentage of people is like that.The vast majority of people tells their idea as the only truth. Then shares no proofs, no examples to sustain their thesis.At this point I usually tell them I understand their point and I explain my precise doubts about it. Then I formulate an antithesis to their thesis and answers to all the points they talked about in their thesis.And at this very point they change the subject of the discussion and claim I said something different to what I really said. They made up things I didn’t say at all. So I explain again my point, I make it easier to understand eventually and I also repeat the exact words I said before.In the end, when they don’t know what to say, they end up attacking me personally or making fun of me (They use to take a look at my profile to collect few personal informations that lead them to nothing relevant to the topic).Clearly logic isn’t the right way to communicate on the internet.Too many people get mad, they start insulting me and assume I am a selfish riot (especially if they’re over 35 years old).But I don’t understand why a conversation should always end up with people insulting each other.In the end, is there a way to make assumptions without provoking anger in these individuals?If you have the same problem, please let me know",Why do people always misunderstand what I say?

She may not know what feelings of resentment I truly harbor towards her for many of her past actions, because our 'getting along' these days is really just surface level, at least from my perspective, and I don't bother talking to her about my emotions or perspectives on anything as she's never willing to hear them out without getting angry and defensive.She always thinks anything anyone says or does with her even slightly involved is a personal attack, even when it's quite clearly coming from a place of communicational effort or constructive criticism/advice. Doesn't even have to be direct, just if it involves her in ANY way, she will find a way to feel upset over it. This is why I don't get along with her.My brothers are all on her side, and fail to notice her hypocritical and self-serving behaviors, nor do they realize what bad mental effect it's had on them that are caused by them either. She's not a bad person, or even necessarily selfish, but she just seems to me to be VERY misguided.

And since I can't **recite every exact word or succession of events to a T in a past conversation of any given time** like she wants if I'm going to even try pointing out the way I feel, with or without actually trying to direct criticism towards her, I have zero advantage.For as analyzing and self-critical as she is, she just doesn't seem to get this. The ways she's critical of others is not fair, but the way she criticizes herself isn't fair either I guess.&amp;#x200B;She refuses to ever believe she's wrong, and that statement is one I actually DO know for a fact and can say without ANY doubt. Even she'd admit to that. Doesn't stop her from not realizing how many times she's close-minded and projective, though. She just needs to see others' perspectives and realize that everyone does not think or communicate in the same ways and styles that she does, but she clearly has MUCH trouble with this.  Which is fine, if she'd listen to advice. But she doesn't listen to advice even in day to day life.  She always thinks her way is the only way, essentially, and claims that because she's older she's 100% always the one that's more experienced and therefore always the 100% right one with no faults in her methods.  Not playing into consideration that I'm an independent 22 year old whether she likes it or not and that I AM actually intelligent (which she says I am but doesn't TREAT me or any of my siblings like we are) and I DO actually understand things even with how deprived I've been from life experiences, and I DO have a good sense of intuition and experience and know right from wrong and how to judge character correctly  Hell, when I've talked about others before and got her advice on it, she's even affirmed my suspicions to be correct, so you'd think she'd know this about me. Doesn't matter what experiences she has with me though, she only seems to remember and think about me what she wants to remember and think about me. Only sees it from her perspective and never considers anything else.  Since none of my family ever trust in my perspectives though *(we're all very stubborn and I'll admit I'm stubborn to taking in others views too, but I'm not proud of it and that wasn't always the case, just began to be a lot more so as I learned that they don't listen to anyone else but themselves and I have a hard time healthily dealing with that all cooped up in one house with no escape for so many years)*, I have a lot of self-doubt.  Her actions have broken down much of my confidence/self-esteem/trust in myself. So even though I wholeheartedly believe that I see this stuff in her, I know no one else in the family would believe me or even just stop and consider for a moment that I may be on to something and that I actually have reason to believe what I do, and that makes it so I can't help but wonder if maybe I'm deluding myself about this and I am genuinely wrong. Or if I'm somehow not understanding or seeing from the right perspective(s) on this.  &amp;#x200B;I love her, I don't like not having a good relationship with her - ESPECIALLY when I'm forced to keep it so private so that I have to fake pleasantness with her - But I absolutely refuse to give in to her whims when I feel she is being completely unreasonable and I DON'T want to encourage that, and she doesn't let either of us heal from this or work things out.Which is a huge problem, since every advice ever about dealing with INFJs and issues/arguments that I can find tells me to essentially stroke their ego and just agree that they're right, and no one gets that I don't want to do something like that when it serves NO ONE higher good and will just make that person and their life/relationships worse for them and everyone else involved if they keep on that road.  And I've already done enough of that in my younger years. I used to side with her on things so much, but that's because I genuinely saw her as right for most of it (which I'm not as sure about now that I'm much older and have gained a lot more perspective and understanding of psyche and relationship problems).  Then she either got worse; or I had more insight and understood better the circumstances and realized that she wasn't right in everything, and I began to feel less and less right consoling her with zero critical advice involved on the matter that I knew I *should've* been giving.Then it came to a point where she just stopped being open to critical advice altogether, and instead of becoming sad or upset with herself which at least allowed her to reflect and better herself based on what others and herself thought, she became closed off from hearing what anyone else has to say and now she just doesn't budge at all, and she's not willing to improve because it seems to me she doesn't think she has anything to improve *on* \- At least not if the advice comes from anyone else's brain or mouth.Which is why I feel like I'm partially to blame for leading her in more recent years TO be this bad; To not take responsibility for her downfalls or to be more open-minded of others' perspectives and feelings and whatnot. And I don't know how to undo it, or if I'm even seeing this right at all, or how to deal with it and fix things.  Worst of all, her bad and stubborn behavior and all the trauma I carry with it brings out the worst in me, and I absolutely can't stand it. Since we both fight just as hard back as the other, and we both feel pain/upset/resentment, it's just an endless and vastly damaging cycle that really only gets worse as time goes on.    **I feel guilty** and overly stubborn for me thinking all of this, but at the same time, my heart tells me I'm right, that I KNOW I'm right, y'know? But since I have no means of talking it through with anyone, I'm just constantly stuck, and with nothing else but my own internal battles of whether I'm being fair or not in this.  I know this is what I've experienced... And if I'm not right, then there is even more of a lack of understanding between us than I thought.  No matter how much I reassure myself on my experiences, why does their opinion still make me question if I'm not right on this one? It seriously peeves me.I mean, I have always had every other person in the world pegged for their character. I can see right through people - I have great intuition and I've learned how to easily identify people by recognizing patterns.   I KNOW when someone has an unhealthy mentality, when they're being critical or manipulative or self-serving, when they're projecting. I've DEALT with people EXACTLY and very obviously with those issues, and it's caused me a lot of damage in the past.Why would a person I know the BEST be any different? Let alone LESS likely for me to be correct on?",Unhealthy relationship with INFJ mom - Help?!

The move was invisible and did not register to the AI as being the best move.But, the human chess player defied the AI and did a move that the AI did not see as dominant.So the theory... In the future AI will bypass normal functioning in the human brain to induce spontaneous outcomes such as those mentioned above while the AI takes care of the normal day-to-day functions since it can do so at maximum efficiency without relying on a miracle breakthrough to happen.

1241,intj,"The current belief for most people is that AI will actually replace us and become in a way separated from us. But in fact, I believe artificial intelligence allows us to understand intelligence, thinking,  ideas, creativity, so we as humans. So basically, if we can understand how to develop and analyze artificial intelligence, we analyze ourselves and discover an opening towards our own progress as an individual. However progress takes a different definition here, because we are not really in fact progressing,  we are just more and more revealing ourselves to us by manifesting ourselves throughout it. Artificial intelligence therefore becomes an opening towards us, a deeper insight towards who we are and who we can become, which is ourselves. By creating artificial intelligence, we create the self of tomorrow. Our future, but still our us from today that haven't been manifesting. What we do is constantly becoming ourselves. Everything comes from inside of us and then goes outside of us. Everything exists and is waiting to be manifested.  Theory related to quantum physics but also being and time by Heidegger and it also illustrates the theory of the game of life when we apply it to one individual. In that case, living well and living fully and becoming more and more yourself would be continually making choices that opens up possibilities for even more choices and options.  So always looking for the optimal option that makes you less constrained.  That's a bit like Ai works and we should definitely take example from that.  That is an example on how AI is making us ourselves even more.",Are we becoming AI or is AI becoming us?

Though that is the RIGHT perspective and you can make friendships and gain a qualification that separates you from the herd and puts you on a level closer to the intellectual elite of society. It can also help you get a better salary than your peers. Though it's not the campus but the *qualification.most employees would love to only do what the job application wants them to and bosses would always annoy the crap out of them to do more than that.High school counsellors are part of a BS service.Uni can get you far if you're a teacher's pet and have a high gpa.

Networking is good everywhere, just choose the right discipline like Law or Medicine and work hard. Law at Harvard is the same as Law at the Michigan State University or whatever other university. It's the GPA for a doctorate or Masters degree that makes you stand out in the job market. Executive positions sometimes expressly ask for that or previous work experience. I know because both my parents have masters and doctorates and always get offered top positions in companies or universities.Anyway a LLB can also be very impressive on a resume.Other than that, top students usually are good at networking so they can find their way into a good job somehow, which is the ultimate purpose of having a degree.

1281,intj,,Only Downside Of Being An INTJ.
1282,intj,I’ve taken a few different online test and I get either INTJ or ISTJ.,What’s the main difference between INTJ’s and ISTJ’s?
1283,intj,There’s all this stuff I want to do but I just can’t get myself to do it.[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/krnxsd),Are any other INTJ’s lacking motivation?
1284,intj,"So I’m in my last year of high school, and given the current circumstances (the fact I’m likely to not have to take my final tests and will instead simply be given a grade) I’ve found myself, aside from the school work I’ve been set online - of which there is not tons - and a few video calls, I’ve found myself doing a few things and I’m wondering if any of you feel the same. Okay so firstly I would like to say that these things have been constant ‘habits’ of mine for a long time and I have always found myself doing these things, it is just that now this mindset of mine has really taken over everything else I thought about.Given the nature of lockdowns that of course means home study for me, as well as a lot of free time. The problem for me is that I have found myself to be somewhat of a secret geek (I present myself as more of a sports lover etc.) and while I do love soccer I also play many video games and have immersed myself in many media franchises. Think the Batman movies, The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, etc. But, now that I’m having so much spare time in having many issues sort of balancing things in my life. Last time lockdown happened I though I handled things rather well but now, this being my final year, I feel the stresses of school (which I could easily repress upon returning home) have started to creep into my home and the issue with this is that I don’t know how to balance it now.I’ve always had this thing (I really hope in not alone in this) where I treat certain leisure activities like a chore and many nights before bed, for many years, I have had a few minutes before actually laying down in which I tell myself “okay, so I need to watch [Movie A], some episodes of [SERIES B] start reading [BOOK C] and play a little [VIDEO GAME D].” However, the issue really is none of this gets done, and especially recently I have found myself waking up around 8-10, laying in bed watching YouTube for a bit, getting watched, finishing school (with a moderate amount of procrastination, however I get done what has to be done and have never handed anything in late or to a bad standard so I don’t see that as an issue given how uninterested I am in the subjects which I procrastinate from) and only playing ‘VIDEO GAME D,’ as I called it. Technically I know all I want to do in my heart is play the video game, but the thing is I don’t.I’m a bit of a geek as I said, and when I don’t have immediate problems to sold or a goal to work to (I even have trouble my school work as worth doing as I’m likely to just be given high grades anyway due to lockdown) these franchises I spoke of begin to take a large precedence over my life, meaning I grow attached to not necessarily a character or anything, but the world itself. That’s why I find myself on YouTube for so long watching clips from a series or movie I’ve already watched, but then I’m not willing to go and watch a new movie or series because I don’t want it to disrupt the relationship I have with these other ones. It’s weird I know...The most immediate example I can think of is the Witcher. I played the Witcher 3 at the start of first lockdown and loved it (won’t get too far into that) but after playing it I remembered this game was literally the end of an 8 or 9 book series then 2 games which served as sequels to those books, and I instantly wanted to learn more about the world and the other characters. However I just can’t push myself to read the books or even watch the Netflix series yet every night I feel stressed out because of the amount of series and franchises I want to learn more about, then I just wake up, work a while to forget about those things and then play a video game and watch YouTube again before repeating the routine.I know this was a long read, but I was just wondering if anyone else does this? Sort of builds up something as simple as a movie, series or franchises you enjoy to the point where, devoid of anything else to do, your mind makes it a chore for you to learn more about the franchise and solidify your enjoyment of it, and you really stress over what you want to ‘learn’ about it or what you want to watch next. It doesn’t need to even necessarily be one series either. Like, when I lie in bed before sleep my mind always pesters me about how I want to watch ‘Shutter Island’ and ‘American Psycho,’ but then I just wake up and... don’t do it...Please let me know if you feel the same way about overanalysing or building up simple leisure tasks in the absence of an actual larger, short-mid term goal because it’s something I’ve really been pestered by for a while and I’m curious whether or not I’m alone on this.Thanks.",INTJ overanalysis

1290,intj,"I know that celebrity culture isn't really something INTJs are usually interested in, and I'm one of those INTJs that can acknowledge the sadness of a situation but not feel it intrinsically. However, there have been two exceptions to that in my life. The first was Anthony Bourdain who was just a man I deeply admired for his open-mindedness, his intelligence, his genuine desire to leave this world a better place than he came into it etc. His death stung pretty bad for me. The other one was yesterday.[Alexi Laiho passed away yesterday](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/04/entertainment/alexi-laiho-children-of-bodom-death-intl-scli/index.html), and for those who don't know he was the lead singer and lead guitarist of Children of Bodom, and I had a really hard time not bawling. I picked up a guitar when I was thirteen because I'd heard [""In Your Face""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACuk9GgL0uI). Up to that point I'd only been a fan of Nu-Metal (Korn, Slipknot etc.), but then I saw this fucking badass with a cool Yellow and Black Flying V just ripping, and for the first time I knew what being empowered felt like. I'm not going to go over my childhood for the billionth time, but it wasn't good. I genuinely mean this, music (particularly metal) probably kept me from suicide. And some of my most cherished memories from that time was trying to learn the riffs I loved and a lot of solos from Alexi. I've played ever since, wrote and recorded my own music, played a few gigs with a few bands locally, and I wouldn't trade those memories for anything else in the world. I've remained a fan of Metal since then, over half my life at this point, and it's all thanks to Bodom and Alexi in particular.I know that mourning somebody you never met is stupid, but I can't help feeling deep deep sorrow the past couple days.

When that happens I end up learning a lot of knowledge from doing so which makes me proud of myself.Whenever someone asks me about the subjects I learned, I like to explain it to them how it works to them (kind of like INTP's). But if someone asks me too much of it and hit a certain wall beyond my capability, I just say ""idk man ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ why do you care"" and just move on.

But, sent her a message and made a sincere apology and asked her about the things I've done, she opened up (which I take as she is still caring for me, but unsure maybe).Then, I asked for her advice and help on something, she gave me her advice (which made me believe she still loves me in some way) and hasn't blocked me, and still communicates with this throw-away account, but told me it was your idea to keep distance and based on past experiences with you, I think you are right, we should keep distance.

1319,intj,"So recently I thought of a storyline and it’s just a bit but I realised how much the character reflected my personality. I was originally trying to make her a bit different, but then I just poured all my thoughts in and now it seems like she is just some ungrateful  person. Well here it is:“Hello, I’m Jenny. I’m 12 years old, a 7th grader. I have a twin sister, Ellie, who has an utterly different personality as me. We started out as the same cell, but we ended up quite different. “I’m never able to cling onto my hobbies a lot, usually a few months. For example, I loved reading when I was smaller, but I quickly loose interest in a book after I got busy and didn’t read it for a while. At the summer which I was about to get to 7th grade, I learnt to solve a Rubik’s cube, which I now call it a 3 by 3. It has become a hobby of mine, and this is my fourth month. Pulling down my times are so satisfying. “I have mild signs of social anxiety. I never really have any people who I could feel comfortable with, and I worry a lot if there are no responses after I say something, even if it’s just me and my mum, sometimes my sister.“It was until my crush came. It was my first time in a mixed school, so I had a rather different approach towards boys. I found him attractive at first, then his laugh, his voice and his ways sunk into my heart. I confirmed that I had a crush on him and would often get jealous or upset when the hot and cute girls went up to him to have some fun or just talk. I would try them by approaching them, but I got scared and turned away. When I asked my crush on purpose what the next class was, his smile faded away, and he looked down at me (I’m not even 5 feet yet, you see) in a serious way, looking straight into my eyes. My heart beat faster and I felt a sensation in my chest that could not be let down. But then I squeaked a thanks and I was very embarrassed. It was just too awkward. I hurried away.“I had gone through obsession, and I knew it was all just a crush and it would be over in no time. Surely, after two months, I heard my mother say that the middle school I was in had fairly unsatisfying results for public exams, and that was the only school that accepted me back in July. No other better school would do more on that waiting list that has never been my turn. I decided I was going to find better opportunities. I developed a thought to go to UK for boarding school. All my thoughts were on it. I decided to give up my crush to chase my dreams. “But too much was holding me back. My jaws were small but my teeth were as usual, all those permanent teeth couldn’t possibly fit in my mouth. I had to get dental treatment like braces, which if I was lucky would take 18 months, but it may last up to 4 years, and there may still be plenty of follow-ups later on. With my parents not in the country, I couldn’t possibly go to the UK to get braces without a lot of trouble and expenses.“This reminded me of another bothersome situation. Boarding school along with tuition fees were very expensive. Middle class families couldn’t possibly afford it.

He always seems very alert/aware when there’s a chance that in a situation a Guy could take advantage of me in some way or another and it’s never like because they said or didn’t something but just like in a ‘’gut feeling’’ type of way.He is always right too lolHe’s told me he isn’t the jealous type which he never has shown any sign of jealousy whatsoever or controlling me but when these things happen I feel like it’s the closest to jealous I’ll ever see him be or maybe the closest to protective?So I was wondering if you guys can relate?Do you guys get protective of the person you like and make sure your very intimate stuff in the relationship are protected from the outside world that’s not close enough to you to know the details?

1371,intj,"This is the last part of my IN - hunter-gatherer comparison.  Let me know what you think of it.   I have been arguing that neurodiverse people have ancient hunter-gatherer minds living in a farmer society. Many aspects of neurodiversity can be understood from this alone, e.g. that farmer-herder types make up well 75% of the population, The remaining 25% make up hunter-gatherer types, who are generally less attuned to social norms and less conformist. It's also estimated that up to 25% of the population are neurodiverse. A lot of aspects of neurodiversity often get “pathologized” when we are really only dealing with our evolutionary programme here: minds that worked well for millennia in hunter-gatherer societies, but that often function poorly in our modern society when it comes to “rote farmer tasks”. A lot of neurodiverse people struggle in school (rote learning) and 9-5 routine “farmer” jobs. As Thom Hartmann (who discovered the link between hunting and ADHD) says, hunter-types in offices are probably the reason why coffee is the number one drink in the world.Here is an overview of evolutionary types (with their respective temperament):&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/t9dj57kh0a961.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62fa9bcad2d0baef10dc42388b34659567e5f946These types may be somewhat mixed, but much less so than expected due to a phenomenon called “assortative mating”. Assortative mating aligns nicely with these four types (i.e. farmer types having a preference for farmer type mates, etc.)Imagine putting a hunter-gatherer into a farmer-herder society. The first thing that will probably happen is some kind of pathology, starting with food-allergies (wheat and dairy), and other problems like irritable bowel syndrome,  leaky-gut syndrome and hypothyroidism. Hunter-gatherers are not adapted to a farmer diet and so the body “malfunctions” and pathologies arise. Up to 70% of children with ASD are reported to have gastrointestinal problems. Of course, they don’t have “original” hunter-gatherer bodies, as their hunter-gatherer ancestors probably integrated into farmer societies centuries ago. So, they do have the ability to digest “farmer” food, but it may be less developed than in farmer types.Moreover, a lot of these problems may also be related to higher stress levels. Having a hunter-gatherer mind that is not entirely adapted to a farmer society is bound to cause increased stress levels. There is a well-known correlation between high cortisol and alcoholism and I bet a lot of hunter-gatherer type people use alcohol for self-medication. High alcohol use can also be found in real hunter-gatherer populations who are assimilated into our civilisation: Native Americans, Nunavik and Australian Aborigines. Among neurodiverse young people with ADHD show the highest risk of addiction with more than 25% of adolescent substance use having ADHD. And this number pales in comparison to online and gaming addiction:*A 2-year prospective study found that adolescents diagnosed as ADHD were the most likely to be addicted to the Internet than other psychiatric symptoms such as hostility and social phobia* ([source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5517818/%23:~:text%3DA%25202%252Dyear%2520prospective%2520study,and%2520social%2520phobia%2520%255B5%255D.&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1609751463130000&amp;usg=AOvVaw11Ieozk_1Zwuj8-14YbdGc)).Where does the social anxiety and hostility that we frequently see in neurodiverse people come from? The following lesson from history may give us a clue:*“\[…\] when the Spanish began their conquest of South America, one of their earliest settlements was at the site of modern Buenos Aires. The settlement was a colonial failure and soon abandoned because the local hunter-gatherers refused to work for the Spanish, even under extreme duress. When the Spanish ventured farther inland and encountered agriculturalists in Paraguay, they easily subjugated the local people by conquering and replacing the aristocracy \[…\]” (*from: William von Hippel *The Social Leap)*  What was the difference between the hunter-gatherer and agricultural societies the Spanish met? Agricultural societies are hierarchically structured. Conformism is an absolute must in order to avoid hierarchical conflicts. The Paraguayans agriculturalists, therefore, didn’t find it too hard to live under Spanish domination (after some initial resistance). However, the egalitarian hunter-gatherers could never have lived as slaves for the Spanish.Having egalitarian hunter-gatherer minds neurodiverse people find it hard to fit into social hierarchies. Pair this with an aversion to 9-5 routine work and it is easy to understand why so many people with ADHD (e.g. Richard Branson) drop out of school and become self-employed and entrepreneurs. Social anxiety and hostility are also consequences of the egalitarian mindset. Imagine the ADHD kid who is both aggressive towards peers and teachers and fearful at the same time. This is not proactive aggression, it is clearly reactive aggression  My guess is that most children who develop oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) are hunter-type children.To sum up, a host of phenomena seen in neurodiverse children can be understood as them not living in the right kind of environment and are therefore evolutionary mismatches. As I have argued before pattern-seeking cognition and hypersensitivity are among these, as are:* Social anxiety* Defiant behavior (seemingly “antisocial” behavior)* Depression* Substance use* Online and gaming addiction",INTJ and hunter-gatherers: part III - difficulties adapting to a “farmer” society

1379,intj,"I (25 M) feel like this is a very real issue in my life that I haven't been able to overcome. 5 years ago, I had my first romantic experience, which unfortunately wasn't a positive one. However, I became much more emotional as a result and gradually started feeling compassion towards other people. This was also a period  in which I made some new friends and further cemented some existing friendships. I also felt overall better and more in tune with myself and the world around me.Fast forward to present day, I feel like my progress has pretty much diminished. And I'm back to square one. I can understand people and their struggles just fine but it's more or less on the logical side. Because of this, I'm finding it hard to connect with just about everyone. I feel like my previous state was in part trauma induced, and once I was able to overcome it, I was back to the way I had been before.Does anyone have any advice on this? I've been thinking that performing certain mental exercises or exposing oneself to particular situations may be helpful, but I still have no idea how to approach this. Also, I'd prefer not to force and for it to happen organically. Thank you for your time!",How can an INTJ develop more empathy?
1380,intj,"My boyfriend works as an EMT and has been transporting covid patients. Last Tuesday he had a stomach ache, threw up, and a temp of 100.4 degrees. He brought me home and I’ve been quarantined since until he gets a negative test. This was last Tuesday and he hasn’t gotten the test still (now Sunday).While he’s waiting to get the test he’s basically just been home in bed doing nothing. He’s upset because he’s missed 3 long shifts and counting, can’t go to gym, and overall is feeling extremely unproductive. In a typical day he likes to keep his days jam packed and constantly doing something. He has a long record (and I’m assuming many other INTJs) of getting frustrated when he doesn’t have a goal or a sense of purpose. In the summer he had Lyme and had to avoid sunlight due to the antibiotics and got depressed and disappeared with no contact for 3 days. After much discussion he hasn’t disappeared without contact again. But today he only wanted minimal contact - few texts and wanted to go to bed. As an ENFP I always want to talk and if he doesn’t want to I want to know why and what’s wrong. He said he doesn’t want to talk about it and just wants to go to bed. He agreed that he would further discuss it tomorrow but I’m worried about the long term. Is this okay? Do other INTJs get like this when they feel unproductive? Is this healthy to get this depressed over this? How can I support him? Any insight from other INTJs. My boyfriend and I have great communication and will definitely discuss to best fit what he needs. I’m just curious from the wider perspective if this is okay.

1381,intj,"First things first, I love INTJs. My father is one, and we have an amazing relationship. I can come to him with any problem and he will solve it, or attempt to. I find you guys wise, intelligent, and capable individuals. But my observations of him and other INTJs have raised concerns about their supposed compatibility with my type. First. The Fe blindness. It coupled with the Te preference means that I can only express myself in direct terms, and things like body language and subtle expressions seem to go completely unnoticed. I could have the largest frown on my face, and completely reserved body language, and answer shortly, and my INTJ father would still go on without a clue. I'm a woman and while I had no problem being a brash and outspoken teenager, I've become much more reserved and nuanced in my communication. I don't want to have to constantly voice my feelings, and would rather be read via body language. My father will tell me that he knows how I feel and then demonstrate little actual empathy. Maybe he does on a cognitive level, but it doesn't seem he really ""feel"" it. As well, I really aspire for a ""happy home"" in married life. Fe users have a knack for curating a mood and bringing people together as a group. INTJs seem disinterested in these things. And while I enjoy a close relationship with my father, my ISTP brother receives little of the same effort and, honestly, love, that I do (As he doesn't conform to Te achievements, he is seen as somewhat useless by my father). It's completely unequal. As an Fi user, I know the harsh truth that we play favorites. But I would hate to put children in a similarly unfair situation. I would hate to be the only one taking initiative with family things or children (my father for example has never changed a diaper in his life...a moment of silence for my poor mom). I also wonder how well two Fi users could actually work in a relationship. My Fi is intense, and something I usually feel the need to downplay. Would dating an Fi user be ""too much""? Would it feel like joint insanity? I briefly dated an INFP, and it was like all he saw of me was a smokescreen to project his own fantasy reality onto. I disliked this a lot. As well, there's an INTJ who is currently pursuing me despite me having told him I wanted to be friends (in multiple ways/nuance). It seems he isn't able to accept it. His Ni-Te has locked onto me as a ""goal"" and I have become a pursuit for him. Not only is it somewhat dehumanizing to be a ""prize"", it's selfish in that his feelings are the only thing that seem to matter in this situation. He will often vent to me but doesn't seems to notice that I never do the same. And he just. Keeps. Pursuing. It puts me in the uncomfortable situation of having to be blunter and blunter and feeling quite mean for it. I really believe ENFP women can appear as manic pixie dream girls, but we aren't a prize or level to beat. Where is the consideration for our feelings? Please let me know your thoughts, and I truly hope this doesn't come across as bashing. I am just genuinely curious as to how this compatibility could have downfalls in this regard, away from the stereotypes. I would love to hear some real life experience, especially with Fi-Fi relationships, from you! I know some of this could be individual/off mark. Thank you very much for reading 🙏🏻","Why I am unsure I can date an INTJ, as an ENFP woman"

1394,intj,"I am a female (18) who recently took the Myer Briggs test and after reading the description for INTJ I felt understood for the first time ever. Everything makes sense now and I know why I am the way I am. I am wondering if anyone else prior to finding out they are an INTj were constantly struggling to play the ""social game"" but played it anyways? I am now realizing that I had been constantly exhausting myself trying to be bubbly, charismatic, and impressionable like my female counterparts because I had observed them, and saw that acting this way granted them male attention, free stuff, access to partys and groups groups etc ( I now realize that I shouldn't force myself to act this way anymore because it was so forced and not myself)I read that INTj's are most attractive when they are not trying to be and when they are putting their energy into their passions. I find this to be very true, but at the same time it is really hard for me to put effort into my passions, and try to pursue people at the same time. I think it can be hard as a female INTJ because men my age like women who give them attention in a stupid flirty way. I am passionate, just in a more intellectual way if that makes sense? I have such a hard time playing along with traditional dating rituals, I get such a bad ick from it, which is why I normally resort to be-friending men and becoming platonically close before pursuing them romantically. I am also quite cold with my body language and touch when I don’t know someone well, which i think a lot of guys find strange.Anyways, what I am wondering is: Am I just setting myself up for disappointment for wanting a real connection with someone? I am afraid that because I am not very flirty, that I will not be able to attract the people I desire/ are intrigued by. I have been told a lot that I am very pretty/beautiful, but I don’t think  I have been told that I am attractive in a sexy way, ya know?",Am I just setting myself up for disappointment for wanting a real connection with someone?

She texted me back basically trying to give her reasoning for her emotions and today I met up with her and that'll be the following paragraphs.I had her come over to my house for some coffee and to talk. And it turns out she was sexually assaulted. I'm not going to go into detail as it's unnecessary to the rest of this post, but in her mind I violated a sense of trust she had given me without me knowing. This is going to sound like me trying to advertise that I'm a good guy, but she said certain actions of mine and certain conversations lulled her emotionally into giving more trust than she usually does to men (translation: she idealized me and when I didn't live up to the ideal she built in her head, she felt betrayed).So I just apologized, assured her that I don't think sexual assault is an non-issue and if I see it occurring I'll do everything in my power to stop it. Some other stuff happened. She then asked why I never asked her out. I told her she never gave me indication that she liked me in that way. She then said she flirted with me at least a few times a week. I mentioned this in the previous post, but she would do things like giggle at something I said, say something vaguely insulting like ""that's dumb"" or ""you're so extra"" (yeah I cringed at typing that just as much as you did reading it) and then lightly slap my arm. That's flirting? Really? Is that other INTJs experience with it. It made me look back and that's not the first time I've ever been flirted with like that, and honestly it seems like the exclusive way I get flirted with. Not sure why women who are interested in me want to knock me down a peg as well, but it is what it is. We had a conversation where I said I'm not going to date her, partially because I don't want to be with someone that idealizes me, I'd like to still be seen as a human being in my relationships. But, I'm also moving halfway across the country in 2 weeks and I have no faith she could handle an LDR or that I'd want to invest in an LDR for any significant amount of time. So, that's the conclusion of that. Learned a bit more about emotions so it wasn't all for naught.

1432,intj,"Hi, 25y INTJ male (although I sometimes identify as ENTJ and a little bit INTP). One of my goals for this year is to be more passionate, less rigid and calculated. The past years I've kinda been struggling romantically and I want to change that. My last relationship (which was with an ENFP) ended because I was too rigid and didn't seem like I cared that much about her. Now there's this girl who's been a total crush of mine for the last two years. I asked her on a date once, we went out and then nothing happened (I didn't insist either so I don't know exactly that happened there). Anyway, from what she told me then, she was (and seems like it) an INFJ, if that says anything. We keep seeing each other from time to time because we have mutual friends. She actually initiated some hangouts lately. Anyway, I went to her place a week ago with some friends, had fun, but at one point she mentioned so randomly that she had sex with her manager (that kinda crushed me a little, but on the other hand, she's a free person, we're not together...but why would she mention that?). And later on we started a heated argument about how, judging by our astrological signs, we aren't compatible. (She doesn't believe in that at all though). We were both pretty drunk so I don't remember much. Two days later, I went to a New Year's party with mutual friends of hers and she came there as well (with another guy...who might've only been a friend, because they seemed close but not really intimate). Funny thing is... another guy there was a Tarot reader and I asked him about my love life in 2021 (I don't believe in this stuff and he didn't know me). What's funny is that he guessed that I've been involved with another person for the past years and that we haven't actually done anything because I am too cold and the other person has past relationship issues holding her back. But that there is a lot of passion from my end and some passion from her end and that we will try to resolve this in 2021. At this point, the girl I liked (who had been paying attention) pointed out that she doesn't believe in Tarot but that I am indeed too cold with women. Now... do you think that Tarot guy was right? Could there be some passion from her end as well? I can usually read other people decently, but I can't read her at all. I don't even know what to do in this situation. Should I drop her completely and move on with my life? Should I try to pursue her somehow? But I am indeed too rigid now, I don't know how to be more passionate with her or flirt with her.

1440,intj,,How to talk to an INTJ.
1441,intj,"I've watched this video from LiJo where she talks about how INTJs / Ni users never get bored and I wondered if that's true for you?I certainly don't get bored easily. I mean, I haven't left the house for 2 months now and I feel perfectly fine being in my room doing ""nothing"" (which is being in my head). However, there's this weird sort of boredom in my life. She said in her video that INTJs always think about the next thing to do, so even when they're doing nothing, they always have an escape, hence never get bored. Although this is true, when I never actually get to ACHIEVE my goals, everything just seems a waste of time. It feels like I'm always waiting. What follows is this great boredom which makes me realize there's nothing special about my life at present and I wonder what am I even doing. (This is usually the moment where I decide to finally enjoy life in the present. Unfortunately, this thought always wears off after a few hours) Side note: English is not my first language so explaining this was a bit difficult.

1453,intj,"Hello! I find it really difficult to make friends with women, and find myself in a far more comfortable state when hanging out with guys. In high school, up to the age of about 16, pretty much all my friends were girls and I was part of the “popular” group, without sounding pretentious. However, when I moved into sixth form, I dragged away from this group and sort of became a lone wolf, mainly interacting with a group of boys who soon became my closest friends. 4 years later, I have a boyfriend of 2 years who I met at university, and I pretty much only have one female friend, who was my best friend in my boarding house. She’s a hyper-intelligent ENF-P (which may surprise people), and one of the most interesting people I know to talk to.Problem is, now I genuinely struggle with how to act around girls who aren’t her. I don’t know what it is, but there’s a level of anxiety that I don’t know how to explain when I’m confronted with a group of girls. For example, there’s a few girls that my boyfriend was friends with a school, and so occasionally I’ll meet them in group meet-ups or whatever. If left alone with them, I don’t struggle to have conversation, but I find myself pretending to be kinda stupid, and acting way more girly than I actually am around them.A specific example is when I went to a poker night with a group of my boyfriends school friends. Now, in all fairness, my boyfriend + I really enjoy our poker, and take it quite seriously outside of social poker nights, so of course we’re going to know the basic strategy better than a bunch of people who barely play the game. The boys who we were playing with also did not know much basic strategy, but I think because they thought it was a “cool” activity, they took it more seriously than the girls. I found the girls were very loud despite acting extremely stupidly during the game, and I’d really struggle to make conversation with them, because I just felt we were way to different. Then the self-analytics dropped in. I started thinking that maybe I’m just not “cool” enough to get along with these girls, and that’s why I dislike them - because I find them intimidating or threatening because of their femininity ?When I’m in a group of girls with no boys there, I struggle the most. I find that they’re often talking over eachother, and laughing wildly at shit that I’d just smile at. In my mind, they seem to be competing to be the biggest personality in the room. I end up feeling like shit because I’m not loud enough or comfortable enough to compete with them, as their confidence is all they need to guide them through to social success.With a group of boys, I generally feel far more comfortable. I don’t feel the need to impress them, I will crack a joke and not expect a gaggle of laughter to follow, and I can be quiet if I want to. I can steer the conversation to something I find interesting with general ease, as they seem far more open to someone dropping an unrelated topic into the mix. Basically, I’m really struggling to work out whether the reason I have issues becoming friends with girls is one of the following:1) I am incompatible for friendship with most women due to my personality type. There are women out there I would get along with but I just havnt found them yet.2) I feel intimidated/threatened by them in a social setting, and therefore, don’t even try to make friends with them in the first place and villainize them 3) Something elseWould really appreciate any other female INTJs to share their similar experiences with me, and any INTJs generally to try and work this out for me.Thank you !",Fellow females - struggle with making friends with females ?

1474,intj,"I know that family is important and that family should help each other out. I've been relatively greedy(for a lack of better term) for a big part of my life. By that, I mean that I've always kept to myself. I didn't really want to share toys with other kids(only with close friends). When I bought food or candy, I wanted to keep it to myself, hide it and not share it, because I didn’t want to run out of them fast. Whenever I’d not share something I was called selfish, and I can’t blame them. Whenever I now get asked to do something, like installing lamps, mow the grass, or construct furniture, etc... I tend to delay it for a long time. I mean, I happen to do this only to ‘some’ family members; mainly my mother, sister and father. I tend to be more willing to help out my brothers more, and I tend to become lazy when I have to help out my mother, sister and father. I keep telling them I’ll do the task, but end up being lazy and only do it when they become adamant. I tend to be more willing to help out my close friends more than my own family members. I occasionally talk to friends in the middle of the night, and my mother &amp; sister tell me to quiet it down. Sometimes I forget to do it. I know that with Fi, I can have a tendency to only care about my issues.“Whenever you ask us to do something, we always help you out. We stop our tasks to help you out, while you don’t do the same. We asked you to stop talking in the night, but you seem to prioritize your friends above your family members, which is selfish.” I’m from a culture where family is very important, but for some reason I don’t prioritize them. Whenever teens work vacation jobs in my culture, they give a percentage of their money to their parents, because they prioritize their family, while I tend to greedily hoard my money when I make my own money, and barely give anything to my parents.I know that I’m being selfish. But I’m upset about something. I’ve always been told to take care of my parents when they get old and to let them move into my house. My plans for the future are to move somewhere else and move on my own. I don’t like the thought of becoming a nurse to my parents when they get old. I’m 22, my father is 66 and my mother is 60. So they’re already pretty old and they’re going to reach that age pretty fast. They were always out of energy to raise me, and the difference of generational gap was so large, that I couldn’t relate to them a lot. I feel like they’re helping me out, so that I’d take care of them when they get old. I feel like I’ve been put on this world, just to end up being a babysitting nurse. My family constantly mentions what they do for me, “We’ve done this and that for you, and you haven’t done anything back.” I feel like a debt slave, collecting more debt when I ask them for help.I was poor when I was a child, and my parents used our money to visit our home country several times a year, while they tell me that it’s expensive too take me with them. I can understand it’s expensive. But when you get treated like an expensive burden, it doesn’t make me feel very excited to help them out with things. I felt like I’m an expensive burden, and yet I have to give it my all and take care of them when they get old. I was upset that they haven’t taught me any values. So I guess I felt a bit of a burden to help them out. Helping them feels like paying back a loan. While with my friends, they don’ t really expect anything or have big expectations like my own family. So why do you think I prioritize my family members less, while others more, and prioritizing my friends even more? Does any of you here relate, where you don’t prioritize your family members?

When they got together, he told all of his friends ""I dont love her, she's just easy."" She didn't speak out when she was angry. She didn't push him out of his Si child comfort zone. She let him drink himself stupid every night. She didn't ask to be part of our friend group. She never said more than an ""oh"" when he would post his cat on social media saying ""You're all I need.""Fast forward a year. My boyfriend and I had broken up. My boyfriend asked our friend group to pick a side. Since they all work together, our friend group chose my ex. I was left without friends for a year, because I felt too burned to go trying to meet new people in a town where I dont know anybody but them. It sucked for me, but it is what it is. Hans messaged me and said he still wants to be my friend, but only if I didnt tell anybody. He said he was scared my ex would beat him up. Fair point. Alright.Hans would ask me to hang out, and I'd say okay, only for him to ask me to meet at the end of the road. Once in the car, he would tell me he left his girlfriend in bed. Snuck out and didn't say bye. He continued on, just like every other time I've hung out with him, talking about how much he wants to end the relationship. Said he cheats on her often. I was honest about hoe shitty he is toward her. The next time he asked me to hang out, he pulled the same shit. Just left her in bed like an asshole. She kept calling him asking if he was okay. Hed just let it ring. It was awful. I stopped hanging out with him.Fast forward another year. Two nights ago, he messages me asking me to hang out. Tells me she dumped him hard. Gave him the ol ""its not you, its me."" He starts whining and acting mopey. I obviously don't understand why. Also, good for her!Then he starts moping about how he only has 4 friends and none of them talk. Hello??? Do you remember when you guys all picked sides??? And left me without friends??? None of you checked on me. Am I supposed to feel sorry for you? But I hold my tongue. I tell him I'm busy tonight, but I can hang out tomorrow. ""Oh, I have plans with my friends,"" he says, ""Well, I dont have friends, but I still have people who expect me to be places. I'm just so anti-doing stuff.""..........Any other INTJs find INFPs to be (at least one of) the least trustworthy of the types? Toxic, manipulative, yet actually believe they're the victim.

Apparently the lead singer was accused of sexual assault (specifically pissing on some chick without consent, which is a crime if true) and was fired from the band for that reason she brought that to my attention and without really thinking about it, my response was apparently not wanted. I said something along the lines of ""Oh, that sucks, he's a great vocalist"" and didn't think much beyond that.She kept the conversation going by asking ""Are you still gonna listen to them?"" I responded ""Yes"". She went on a minor tirade about sexual assault (a lot of the same talking points you can find in any Buzzfeed or Huffpost article on the subject) and my last response was ""I understand if you feel that way, I'll recommend another band. But, you need to understand that the sexual assault and the produced music are two different things to me, but I'll make sure to double check any recommendations for that in the future"" She still won't text me back and I realized that far more often than not, I can separate the art from the artist. Chinatown is one of my favorite movies, I love Kevin Smith and early Tarantino flicks, despite all of them being produced by Harvey Weinstein, I can still watch Chris Benoit matches with my friends who are wrestling fans (not a huge fan, but I like the athleticism on display from a lot of guys). In fact, the only people I've said I wouldn't continue to consume their content are people like Amber Heard who I already wasn't watching.Do you guys tend to separate the art from the artist, or are you like my friend and see them as inextricably linked?",INTJs and separating the art from the artist

1493,intj," **My theory of the graph:**It represents the needs of the different mbti groups (though of course, we all need everything). It does not have a reflection on the intelligence, excellence or will-power of each mbti type. In fact, I believe that it is the individual and not their type that deserves merit for those three things.**A friend's theory of the graph:**""I am saying that if you need more and more things to be satisfied with yourself and your own work, then your production and the quality of your success will be higher and higher. Meaning the higher you go in the pyramid, the more likely you will see those particular types in the elites class. I have conducted a social experiment on this too. I found that when you go to places that involves work and creativity and high IQ you are ""more likely"" to find the types in yellow more often""**My understanding of this graph:**Essentially, the graph is illustrating the *needs* of each type. Why do I know this? Because at the top of the graph is the phrase ""self actualization""&gt;Self-actualization, in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, is the highest level of psychological development where the ""actualization"" of full personal potential is achieved, which occurs usually after basic bodily and ego needs have been fulfilled.The graph is based on that model essentially. So for an ISTP, they can do whatever they plan to do based on their interests as long as they have the basic needs to support them. It's why famous ISTPs are referred to as ""robots"".

1512,intj," I feel like I have to choose between improving the system and doing what I like. I don't particularly have much personal pereference so usually it's the Te that dominates over Fi and I'm completely happy with it. Most of the time it's me trying to help others by making them do the correct things or simply suggesting solutions for them but when they reach a certain level of input (or maybe just too much to take for me), I just ignore them and tell them to mind their own business.Most people assume T as being logical and F as being emotional but I don't think that's necessarily true. You can be reasonable and care for others' emotional values, just like how you can be selfish and manipulative to the system for your own sake. One day I had a small argue with my ENFJ girlfriend. She was simply being sympathetic and my Ni wasn't available that time. I tried to reply her by expressing my emotions (which was lacking in the first place) and suggesting some practical solutions for her (btw this scared the $h!t out of her so I stopped) to keep her company and improve our relationship, but ended up depleting my emotions trying to keep up with hers.After that I noticed I was acting a little selfish asking her to do things for me. It's not like in the unhealthy way but was kind of bothersome, creating some disagreement between us. I think my Te was overloaded because I failed to carry out emotional support that she needed, so my Fi sneaked in trying to boss her around for me. It was one of those weird moments when Te needed to use emotions while Fi wanted to ignore them.Well I still think T is most closely related to logic and F is most closely related to emotion, but now I can kind of see how it can be otherwise. Or maybe it was Te trying to act like Fe, but failed miserably I'm not sure. I don't particularly think my Fi is unhealthy and I don't think I was stressed being in a loop nor a Se grip.Any similar experience with your Te and Fi?",How does your Te vs Fi work?
1513,intj,"Ever since I was a kid, I have for some reason been a germaphobe and also obsessed with my spaces being clean and organized. I start to feel very stressed, claustrophobic, and disgusting when my surroundings are in physical chaos. It makes me angry. Over the summer, I was in a serious bout of depression, that once I got out of, I was utterly disgusted with the way that things weren’t organized and collecting dust in my bedroom. Once I cleaned everything up and organized it, I was at peace. I particularly don’t like it when people don’t keep shared living spaces clean. I feel that it requires minimal effort and many people don’t really try (I know it makes me judgmental or whatever), and not doing the bare minimum of cleaning up after oneself is very disrespectful.My little sister notoriously DOES NOT clean the fuck up after herself. I remember one time moving a cushion on the armchair in the living room and literally finding food and candy wrappers stuffed all around the seat. Pigsty. It’s a major part of the reason why I don’t like her: she never listens to anyone, is inconsiderate of shared living spaces, and gives you an attitude if you ask her to clean up her own messes. When she actually does it, she does a shit job, no real effort.One of my boyfriend’s roommates left a puddle of water on the kitchen floor, and others don’t seem to understand how to properly wash dishes or silverware, which is part of the reason I don’t use the communal sponge or dishware. I’m so disgusted by people not even being capable of washing a fork so that there’s *no more food on it*. I don't understand how people reach adulthood and still can't even do this. It’s seriously not that hard and takes a complete lack of manners to leave messes like that around. Drives me nuts.It’s a reason I genuinely desire my own home. I want to be able to isolate myself in a space that I think is beautiful because it’s my personal style and because it is CLEAN.","Is being really bothered by messes a specific INTJ thing, or no?"

As much as I love being self sufficient and independent, I really don’t like feeling trapped or emotionally stunted.

1550,intj,"I’m 18 and I moved out at 15 in the USA, graduated high school, and during the pandemic which were my last few months of school I suddenly stopped talking to all my friends, isolated myself, took shrooms, acid (microdosing other than 2 small trips at the end of each spree) and smoked a ton of weed; and I worked on this insanely complex but simple idea for a website and it would literally change the world. I right away sketched out drawings of its concepts to perfection and started learning to code again, I took 1 html and css class in high school and tricked her with my photoshop skills and made it look like a real website but it was all just a long picture. That’s all I’m saying because that might be end goal but maybe bigger is better for me. I now know a few programming languages for websites but it just got boring because I’m not great w people so organizing my friends who are high as fuck all the time is a struggle of two.But currently I took a gap year which was the best decision ever. have new product ideas literally every day that would perfect so many concepts and I’m not exaggerating. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. New idea. I’m a little low on cash but dealing drugs would be a dangerous way to earn money and I’ve never been about that life anyways. So legal techniques of flipping dough would probs be a good bet.

Please help me on that.Also I’m only 18 but I had no idea grinded isn’t a real word. It’s so commonly used. Like grinded up some weed. Or I grinded on this.

1551,intj,"Hi, my SO in Intj and he admitted that he has trouble socialising / communicating with others. He says he finds difficulty reading the mood in a certain situation. At the beginning of our relationship he was most insecure about this - that he can't 'relate' to most people or social situations. He mentioned on time that he overthinks a situation he's in, sometimes he freezes because of no idea how to respond or continue a conversation. Then he overthinks that other people find him and the situation awkward. He is self-motivated and learning on his own, for example, lately listening to podcasts on communication and reading about empathy. I guess I'm here to ask, as his gf and friend first of all, what would be the best way to help him that I can constantly incorporate in our conversations. Simply conversing might be a practice in itself but I was thinking what is the learning process of most intjs so that our conversations will be helpful on his overall goal to learn.Thank you! PS.

1558,intj,"I posted this to the Type Me sub but I'm putting it here too in case it resonates with any of you or you see something I'm missing.I'm hoping someone will be willing to help me work through some questions I am having about my personality type. About 12 years ago I took my first test and scored as an INFP. I was in my early teenage years and very wrapped up in feeling different than my peers. I very strongly value authenticity and creativity. My family used to say I was a dreamer, and so I related to the INFP description. However, some things didn't add up. I prefer to frame my thoughts and opinions on logic and facts, not on my feelings. My decisions are almost always based on logical analysis. I can look back on my life and see times when I made an irrational decision and these decisions are embarrassing to me. I have regretted the majority of emotional decisions I have made in my life. Other INFPs I have known have told me that I seem too ""cold"" to be an INFP, as I struggle to be emotionally available or expressive except to people I feel romantic towards. I believe in being true to myself, but I also believe that my beliefs should be evolving based on new information and experiences. I don't like it when people say ""that's just the way I am"".I've known for a while now that I'm probably not an INFP but only a few months ago did I retake the test. I got INTP, which has seemed to suit me better. However, recently I have been thinking perhaps I am actually an INTJ. Here's my reasoning:1. My cognitive functions. I didn't know about cognitive functions until recently and had never taken a test for those until last week. Here's my stack: Ni&gt;Ne&gt;Te=Ti&gt;Fi&gt;Si&gt;Fe&gt;Se2. I love to gather information. I love creating new theories and ideas. But I quickly discard ideas that I can't see an application for. I am more interested in being creative as it applies to the real world and sometimes I find knowledge for knowledge's sake pointless.3. I'm very ambitious but I'm also quite private. I am happy doing my own thing and making stuff happen without needing input from other people (except my husband).4. I fear failure but even more so I fear being incompetent and I find that memories of embarrassing situations stay with me for a very long time. I can vividly recall times where I was embarrassed and I still feel sick thinking about them.5. I find it easy to see how things will play out, which seems to be an INTJ thing.6. I'm extremely critical. I can find a way to make anything better. Editing comes naturally to me, as does writing. I have a particular interest in architecture and interior design, which seems to be a marriage between my problem solving skills and my desire to make things look and feel better.Now some things that don't quite add up...I'm not great at math because I struggle to think linearly. I've got the INTP thing of having a million different ideas and not being able to follow a clear line of reasoning sometimes. I find it incredibly frustrating in conversation when I feel forced to contribute before I've had time to establish a cohesive thought. I think that is one of the reasons I come across as scatter-brained when in reality I'm just trying to sort through a lot of noise. I don't enjoy having a tight schedule but I do love organizing my home.Anyway, hoping for some insight! Thanks!",Anyone willing to lend a hand (brain) to help type me?

Growing up, my family never stimulated hobbies or personal independence, free choices. We were always obligated to do what dad wanted.My brothers don't care too much about It, because anyways they don't think carreer is so important and they don't care about freedom.

1580,intj,"Just over a year ago, I (ENTP 32F) met an INTJ (35M) through a mutual friend and as expected, we got on like a house on fire. We were casual acquaintances for a while (he was attached) then after he broke up we started texting much more.The main hitch was that we were in different countries - he was in our home country and I was working overseas. About 2 months after we started chatting he wanted more, but for personal reasons that I couldnt bring myself to disclose at that time (a close family member had committed suicide and my family was falling apart in the resulting litigation over his estate) I wasnt emotionally ready for ""more"", so when he asked if I wanted to be more than friends I said no. Unfortunately I was also struggling with a lot of anxiety from the unprocessed grief and in the process I think I might have hurt his feelings / ego / self esteem when I told him I didnt want to be more than friends - it was direct no after a lot of flirting, but we never really discussed why. Spiralling from the anxiety didn't help. Eventually he decided he wanted to be no more than friends and moved on, which I respect, and hes been seeing someone else for about a year. We still text occasionally, but nothing as electric as before - he's clearly much more reserved now, even more so than when we were only casual acquaintances. I dont blame him, but I've always felt a niggling sense of guilt over how I might've made him feel when I declined his overtures. After a lot of work I've gotten much better, and since it's almost the new year I was thinking of texting him to apologise for behaving poorly back then, kind of like to clear out an old debt before the new year, but I dont know if it would be weird given that it's been 1.5 years since he's moved on.Should I still apologise or would it be too late and therefore inappropriate now?P.S. I also plan to go NC from Jan 1st onwards to get over him and move on - it's getting too hard to try and be friends/friendly when the dynamic seems so much less, well, dynamic than what it could be. I'm not sure why on his part (I can only guess hurt, suspicion of motives, respecting his girlfriend, and being careful not to give me the wrong idea), but I'm also too tired of trying to poke around to find out.",Should I apologize now or is it too late?

1582,intj,"It's been 7 years since I took an MBTI test in my uni with a result of INTJ. It's not what dictates who I am but the INTJ description mostly fit my personality that led me to know more about myself, strenghts and shortcomings alike.As a young girl, I have been always into toys and interests that are traditionally considered masculine. Cue in toy trucks, robots, computer games (RTS and MOBA were my shit till my early 20s) and outdoor things like biking and flying kites during summer but...Deep inside, I also loved wishing to wear girly clothes and even at once, dress up like a Disney princess. I got presents which are dolls (Barbie and Bratz) which I treasured but I felt too shy in being showy that I liked these feminine stuff because it's uncool plus some young girls are downright bratty and I didn't fit in. The dolls sat in my room, only to play with them on my alone time.When I was a teenager, my interests have shifted and to name a few, I loved reading books that anything I can find in my school library which had a vast collection. I also began to fall in love with manga both for boys and girls but I felt too shy showing my love in girls' manga because I had that embarrassing phase of being not like the other girls. I thought having feminine sides and beinv unapologetic on expressing them was regressive and being weak.Then, I developed crushes on guys but had a hard time in getting my feelings across being a shy teen. I ended up being one of the most socially awkward girls in class. Plus, I developed image issues why other girls look pretty and popular while I just look like a nerdy dork. It's not I'm a loner...I have a small circle of friends in my high school which most of them are still my friends up to this day. You know, even opening up my feelings whenever my girl and gay friends talked were such a huge struggle...Then my university days started and it's also funny that I took an engineering major which is usually and still was a male dominated major when I was in college. My major also made me even more shy to express my femininity as I would stand out and was honestly on not being taken seriously with the guys around me at uni. And being around my university days having known my INTJ result on my MBTI, I was also convoluted that I still have my hidden feminine and really emotional, even hopeless romantic side is almost never mentioned in INTJs.  It's like sure, I felt like myself but I was still hiding some aspects of myself that I feel embarrased to show, on fear on being seen as weak and helpless.At college, it's also the time where I started dating guys and even engaging in hookups. Whilst I still look dorky, the guys I dated still find me attractive and ngl, it was a huge confidence boost and the validation I got...but still, I felt lacking because I haven't fully expressed who I am...Then I graduated from uni and went into grad school + my jobs because, I wanna earn and enrich my career prospects (oh boy I was that idealistic and driven back then, now I tread my life choices more carefully). Since I noticed that in the grand scheme of things, people can comment and say shit but at the end of the day, our own happiness is what matters most, ofc not hurting anyone.So having a job and I finally have more money I can afford, I got into the rabbit hole in expressing my femininity more like being into fashion and makeup.That really helped me glow up that usually I'm considered cute or pretty. Ofc, I make it suit my personality and my lifestyle and that, I rarely chase trends. I also picked interests in traditionally feminine activitites like cooking, nail art and sewing which even helped me further personalize my love for cosplay.Also, I tried to explore and develop my emotional side especially with my romantic relationships and even causal relationships. It easn't easy and even up to this day, now as a married woman, I'm still growing and developing to be a better woman, in looks and emotional maturity and aspirations...and not be a toxic partner to my husband.Ngl, now I feel really free and secure that I finally expressed what I like and who I really am. Ofc, many of my traditionally masculine interests still stay with me and having a job as a software engineer, it doesn't hurt and it's not a disadvantage that I express my femininity.

I know there are communities on reddit that focus (no pun intended) on this topic but as we have a distinct way of thinking I figured there might be some good advice here.For me, avoiding carbs during the daytime seems to have the biggest impact, although this applies to most people.  One that I  think is more specific to our types: it is critical that you design your work environment to minimize or eliminate the possibility for interrupted thoughts/thinking.  It seems to take INTJs (myself included) longer to bounce back from an interruption and ""reload"" our thought process.

1612,intj,"Im sure a fair number of us were in the gifted programs at school, or got good grades, or at the very least are confident in the amount of competence we posess.Lately, and I'm sure this is in no small part thanks to the new exposure college has brought me, I've been doubting not only my competency but my intelligence when compared to my friends and peers. On principle, I try to surround myself with people I can learn from. In highschool I had my circles, where certain friends would be specialized in certain areas and bad in others just like me, and in college I'm finding that many people, while remaining specialized, have less bad areas. This results in my feeling of incompetency.In one sense, I like this competition. There are some areas I clearly specialize in more heavily than my college friends, but it's not by such a dominating margin as it was with my highschool buddies. This is good, I think, for improvement and development. If this is not a feeling others have experienced yet, I will give my paltry advice. Feeling incompetent will give you a few options, and but you'll feel the pull towards two options in particular; competition/improvement and self-pity. The problem with competition is it clearly outlines what Jordan Peterson calls the criteria of failure. If you can surpass the goal you are competeing for, you win, if not, you lose and fail. Failure can lead to self-pity. Improvement is a bit more loose. You never quite fail unless you remain stagnant. This is why it may be mosts preferred option, over competition.Self-pity as it pertains to this discussion is likely linked to pride most INTJs find themselves struggling with throughout life. Because we are not as good as the person we compare ourselves to, we feel inadequate. Our pride will have painted a false picture of ourself, a picture that melts when faced with reality.Comparing yourself to others is not usually a good idea, but I feel most do it sub-conciously. Thats why you have to be careful. Where a lot of INTJs can improve, and where I've been working on improving for a long time, is that problem of pride. I would argue that pride is good because of what it does for confidence, but that's just the problem. Pride+Confidence=Arrogance. When the INTJ can improve is finding confidence itself in their ability, not taking pride in the ability and letting that pride breed confidence. In self-reflection, perhaps I placed pride on my competency and not confidence.",Competency and Comparison

1621,intj,"Since last year November I have been working as a business consultant at an advisory agency. This week after the end of the year review assessment I received a letter with my salary increase. It was just so sad, a 3,7% increase. I should be happy with it considering covid-19. But as a company we actually have been doing better compared to last year. Including the fact, I got high appraisals from client, made more revenue then expected and overall I performed better then expected. The only thing what stopped them for giving me a job promotion is that I should do more stuff internally for the company. That is also where I'm stuck at... corporate culture.Before this I was a test consultant at another company but I left since sales had trouble with giving consistent assignments/projects at clients. However, I loved the atmosphere over there. So relaxed, kind of nerdlike people, not caring what other people think, lots of flexibility and freedom. The bosses and managers would also regularly chitchat with you. The layout of the company structure is the Spotify model. But I left since I wanted to be challenged more.At my current company from day 1, during the application interviews I already got a bad vibe from the office. It was just so different, but the bad vibe I ignored. And said to myself they are way more professional, everybody dressed in suits, a very business-like atmosphere. And they are more professional, better PR and marketing, better defined processes from top to bottom, the better looking women are also a plus. So I got the job they were very happy with me since they wanted more technical analytical focused employees and not an extra business administration graduate. But it all went downhill during my first assignment. I did not know then that my manager at the company (not at the client) was a micromanager. And I did not know then that as an INTJ - HSP you detest that kind of manager style, since I never experienced that before. He wanted to know and see everything I did at the client, the emails I send,  the quality of the work I wanted to deliver. It took less then two months to have experienced a breakdown and wanting to leave the company. In the end the assignment would only take 3 months to finish. But since I did not perform as the manager would hope he wanted to know everything I did the next month before my next assignment. Luckily he quit that month. I got a new manager who actually understood me since he had two HSP children. I thrived in the next assignment. Team manager at the client said it was the best team he has ever been in. Largely due to me being injected to the project and we did some catching up in the program since they were a few months behind schedule.  Now I lead a team of Indian developers and I'm the contact person for many third parties. This bounce from weak performance to outstanding performance, got me a salary increase of 3,7%. Whoohoo...So that salary increase triggered some thinking. I do not like the corporate culture at my current company. I got a new manager, third one this year. A very career driven woman, end thirties, single, no children. Does a lot of overtime in the evening. Since the company wants the manager to be on an assignment, and only has 4 hours in the week for managerial duties. You can see it takes a toll on her. I got plenty of messages from recruiters, about if I'm thinking about a company switch, my old company wants me back as well. But I also started with a course in becoming a software developer. So the way I see it I have a few options:1. Stay at my current company, which I don't want to stay at for much longer. Wait till I get the promotion to senior position (looks better on resume) And in my free time focus on my software development skills. Then in the future apply at a company for a software development role. 2. Apply at another company, with great work culture and challenges and not deviate from the wanted salary in the negations. Then at the new job and in my free time focus on my software development skills.3. Apply directly at a company for a software development role, junior is okay. Lacking skills though.

They get pretty emotional and defensive over arguments, so it just made things pretty draining and edgy around the house. I like to just keep to myself during these arguments since I dont really see the point in winning or losing arguments in a small family dinner.. but somehow they all seem passionate about it to unhealthy degrees.It's also hard since I feel like I'm walking on eggshells all the time, since I'm the one that doesnt like to argue they tend to ""take sides"" against me, so everytime I try to make a joke is taken seriously and I'm seen as being rude. I think all of this happens because I confronted some family members about things of the past a few years ago, needless to say it all went wrong haha. I also only got 2 days of vacation for myself after uni ended for the holidays before the family gatherings started. Thankfully I've been by myself for two days now until new years come. I was also pretty tired since I had to be around a lot of people during the semester.Despite all this I found a career that I really enjoy :) and I got good grades for the first time in years.

But I don't think that's the case with deeper and more serious issues. And at the same time, I don't think you can have a good understanding of human nature without having a reasonably high emotional intelligence, and I think this type as a whole probably has a comparatively better understanding of human nature, at least as we grow and mature.",Would you consider yourself to be someone with high emotional intelligence?

1652,intj,"(I'm not sure if I'm in the right place. Feel free to shoo me away if necessary. ;w;)So this INTJ is a classmate of mine. He's not a close friend. I don't even know if we classify as ""friends"". For some reason, though, I seem to see him around often (to be fair, I do encounter his friends quite often, too) and I do feel comfortable around him.He can get quite talkative and lively around his friends, but they say he's very introverted—one of them even said he's the most introverted person they know. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to inquire of how they were able to say so.I pretty much just started thinking about this since we started talking quite often lately.  By often, I don't mean as often as daily, but we very rarely talked before—at least not the kind where we start off talking about academics and we'd end up talking about a multitude of topics for well over an hour. I sort of cut our conversation when I feel like it's gotten too long because... eh, I don't want to start ""feeling"" something I don't want to feel, and even if that were to happen, I wouldn't want to give myself away (still, I'd rather not feel).At some point, in one of our conversations, we ended up with telling each other our ""good points/traits/characteristics"" or ""talents"", if you may. I feel bad that I was only able to list very few for him—half-jokingly, even. My bad that I'm not really observant of my sorroundings—much less of people. He, on the other hand, told me that I was overflowing with such things. He then enumerated a lot (around ten, I think), some of which were similar to what I also told him, and some of which I either don't see, or don't appreciate about myself. In the end, he even added, ""and the list goes on"". Aww, I felt so appreciated—especially because he listed ""intelligent"" first and that's huge coming from an INTJ.There were also a few times when he mentioned information about me which I either already forgot (I can be forgetful, anyway), consider very insignificant, or haven't told even my closest friends. He typically would mention them totally out of the blue. I'm not creeped out but I'm curious of how he knew of those, and if he just really has that good of a memory (if he just found those out by accident and it's normal for him to remember facts about people).Lastly (please pardon the wall of text), there was this one time when I was bragging with my friends about handsome guys that I know of and am acquainted with. I didn't know he was seated right in front of me (though he was wearing earphones, anyway). When our conversation ended, for some unknown reason, I found him looking at me with a poker face. I just gave him a smile and looked away.That's pretty much all. Honestly, I always had this lingering feeling that he had been observing me, but I also always chose not to think anything of it because he never really seemed to treat me any different from others and we've known each other for over two years. Perhaps I'm also just imagining things.Of course, I might have missed some other details and my perception might be biased, so feel free to try considering factors beyond what I've mentioned.Your thoughts will be very much appreciated. Thank you!","Hi, I'm INTP but I need your thoughts. So there's this INTJ..."

Although her situation is ""heavy"" so to speak, he still urgently wants for her to feel better, as he understands that what she is going through must undoubtedly be difficult, and was depressed for a few years himself - although he is a bit hesitant to do so, he offers to let her stay with him, as he truly does want her to feel better/have a place to live in and thinks that he can help her mend her relationship with her parents and younger sister, or at least assist in the process. He buys her coffee as well even without her asking (though he does check to see what she likes,) and follows through on his offer to let this stranger stay with him after hearing about her situation (i.e. she does end up actually staying with him, which is a bit uncomfortable for him as he is introverted, but he figures that he himself will get used to it and wants her to feel comfortable in the meantime.)

1671,intj,"INTJ female (22F) here. from what i’ve read on here and other MBTI subreddits, it seems INTJ-ISFJ pairing is pretty frowned upon. good or bad, what have been ur experiences with ISFJs in different contexts? -meanwhile let me vent for some back story to my question.. i have known an ISFJ uni coursemate (25M) for ~3.5 years now. we’re pretty on-off friends, mostly because i’m in a program that takes me away from the main course-batch very often. so there’s been barely any chance for us to really bond / get closer. otherwise, we get along pretty well whenever we’ve had to work together. recently though, we’ve somehow been speaking almost every day (over text), kinda getting to ‘know’ each other (funny to say this considering we’ve known each other for years lol). after not seeing each other for almost a year (i was overseas for a while and then covid lockdown hit), the first time we’ll be meeting is next week, to go bungy jumping together. so here’s the thing. we’ve alr committed to this bungy jumping thing, which looks like a date but i think is more a chance for us (to him too) to feel things out. so i’m pretty sure both of us have someeeee basal level of interest in each other, but i’m not rly sure if MY interest will ever deepen. while we have pretty fun conversations, and he has a really great sense of humour, any prompts i’ve made to bring a conversation deeper have either been quickly passed over (i.e he’ll just say sth more personal for him and then the convo kinda moves away from that) or the cues simply not picked up. he makes an effort to keep conversations going, but there are times it’s obvious he’s not sure how. but at this point, i’m unsure if it’s innate shyness (which is why he opens up a bit and then goes back to being.. ‘boring’), or if he truly is..surface-level. i highly doubt the latter, but i am genuinely worried. HAHAHA. while he is very supportive and kind and just an overall great person (our core values align p well), he also has this strange insecure streak (it’s more internal, like he’s insecure about his strengths/capability, not so much unhealthy-insecure). though he actively works on fighting that, which i admire a lot, it kinda is a turnoff for me..........because i could be supportive and very loving, but i ain’t about fixing other people. otherwise, he is actually very attractive to me. his value system, principles, faith (as in religion), even sense of humour - all totally up my alley. it’s just this... lack of intellectual/conversational stimulation, and the worry about his insecurity that’s holding me back. i’m in a dilemma, bc on one hand i need to feel things out more before i actually can decide, but on the other i really do NOT want to prematurely lead him on. so....... any thoughts on my situation would be much appreciated. thanks!!

1673,intj,"&amp;#x200B;I would like some insights. I'm (INFJ. 26f) in a relationship with an INTJ (26m). We've been dating for 4 months and became an official couple a month ago, today would have been our first month lol. Anyway. It's been complicated because he's kinda strange in my point of view. We meet on a dating app and we started hanging out a lot together. 3 or 4 times a week, since we live pretty close to each other and we have a ton of free time. When we weren't together we were playing videogames online, he soon meet my parents and introduced me to his friends as his girl. But he constantly reminded me we weren't a couple. He said something very douchy about him being the one ""in charge"" while deciding when we were gonna become a couple, he said ""you would be my gf right now if I wanted"". Which drove me crazy thinking he felt like he was the only one with the power to decide the relationship we had; also he implied he didn't want me to be his gf. We had a fight. He said something extremely rough: ""I like you but I don't like you enough. I wanna make sure I like you enough in the things I care about before becoming a couple""... I mean that's absolutely reasonable, but the way he said it. Absolutely ignoring what I want made me angry and when I tried to explain it to him he didn't understand.For some reason, we kept talking and hanging out. He's fun to be around. So fast forward, our second fight was at the second month. He broke my laptop, he was gonna fix it but he got ""busy with other things"". Then he became super avoidant and started ignoring me and being mean to the point I cried. I ended up repairing it myself which was very expensive (I also got a bit scammed). Anyway, my mom (who is ENTJ and has high intuition) gave me the insight that he might be ignoring me and playing with my feelings because he didn't want to pay for the repair. We made up... again. Fast forward, third month of dating. He officially asked me to be his girlfriend, he brought some chocolates to celebrate. Three days later it was his birthday, we spend his day together and the next day I bought him a graphic card and organized him a birthday party. He was so moved he wanted to cry. It was the first time since he was a kid that he had a birthday party. At first he refused to go until I ""pushed him"". He said it was the best day of his life, he was so grateful and said he didn't want me to leave him ever. That weekend was the peak of our relationship. We were on nine cloud.We are in the forth month. So according to his behaviour, I can say he goes through periods where he's easily annoyed by anything and needs alone time. But instead of asking for it he becomes abrasive and mean. He became bitter because of christmas. He didn't celebrate it at his home and I celebrated it far from him with my family in another state. My sister came home for Christmas so I've been hanging out with her all these days, she lives far and I don't know when I will see her again. Anyway it's been days since I have payed him any attention. Yesterday I was out shopping and came home late at 9pm and he wanted to play warzone with me. I didn't answer his call and he got very angry. So I started asking him why he has been acting so mean in the last few days. He said he was angry at everyone and that I should get used to it or leave. Then he kept saying some self-loathing comments about not wanting to have a family or being on a relationship. That hurt me a lot. All his behaviour hurt me. I asked him if he wanted me to leave him alone and he replied that he doesn't know since he feels like a part of him would regret it. We kept talking. He said some things about his ex gfs and how they were way less sensitive than me. I asked him if he didn't like that about me, he answered ""I didn't say that"". Anyway the more the conversation advanced the more offended I felt. I ended up asking him if he wanted time since he doesn't seem sure about our relationship. He said he would think about it. Which drove me crazy and I answered ""don't think about it. We are having a break""  I feel confused if I did right. He's fun to hang around, we became good friends and he says he adores me but it's hard for me to notice that since his actions don't match his words. Or maybe I'm too sensitive to his roughness. He's nice to me but it's very evident that I'm the one that puts more effort. It hurts me when people say that, even his family and friends think I'm too giving when he doesn't give much in return. I try to not talk about him with my family and friends since I'm gonna be criticized. My friends don't even facebook-like the pictures where I'm with him since they don't like him. I feel like I'm doing something wrong.  He says he adores me and loves me and I'm the best girl he has met in his life but I feel like he's not really committing to the relationship. He didn't even fight the breakup, he just accepted it. He probably was so alleviated of getting rid of me.   Being in this relationship it's like a labyrinth. Whenever I'm finally reaching the goal and having the nice yummy prize (which to me is a happy and stable relationship), but I reach a dead-end once again (he pushes me away and treats me like a stranger). I don't know how to communicate that to my INTJ much less now that we have broken up.   Tl;dr. I broke up with my INTJ after 4 months of dating because I felt like he wasn't into the relationship as much as me.   Any advice, comment, the experience is welcomed. I'm trying to make up my mind about this situation and learn the most I can from it. Thank you.",Insights on a turbulent INFJ-INTJ relationship?
1674,intj," Met a guy (INTJ) online two months ago, who lives 1 hour away from my city. He was busy with exams, so we couldn't meet up for two months. Consequently, this led to a lot of pre-meeting phone calling, messaging, anticipation, and optimism about each other's intellect, values, emotional maturity, and mental chemistry with each other. We finally met up. Anticipations were verbally confirmed and the physical chemistry was insane on top of that. Before he left, we briefly communicated that we were interested in seeing where this goes and that I would meet him soon in his student town once the winter vacation ends.  After our 24+ hour meeting, he left for his family home town for winter vacation, which is much further away from my city. We texted back and forth for about 3 days but messages got a bit shorter than usual from his side. At the time, I attributed it to depleted testosterone and the fact that he was with family so thought nothing of it. Then silence from him for two days, which in normal dating standards is fine...but since we had a 2 month courtship period of messaging and calling from which he was now being inconsistent, I figured he knew I'd be confused and check-in? After the two days passed I messaged him saying ""Hey! I was expecting to hear from you? Have you been busy?"" He then replied in the longest and most vulnerable message he has ever sent to me that he was having a serious family crisis (regarding the dementia of his grandmother and the waning health of his mother in taking care of her etc. I won't go further than that.). Naturally, I gave my condolences and told him to take space if he needed it. To which he replied, ""Thanks, I hope you take care too.""  I didn't really know what to respond to this. So I just took it as him taking space and not talking to me indefinitely. I didn't hear from him for over a week. So just in order to reconfigure and clarify, I sent a message saying that I hope he was well, telling him I'm open to seeing where things go with him cause we have a good connection, etc. That I see that he withdrew, which is totally okay. But that I needed to just get an idea where we stood. Since he didn't really clarify.  He then typed up a huge essay of a text explaining, in detail, what the new family developments were and his difficulty with it, etc. Followed by an ""I don't think I'm in a good situation to date with you. I think I need to take care of things here.""  I then replied again with condolences and worry about him, said that I understood and that I guess the timing wasn't right. I kept it brief and kind because of the conflict of needing to console him but of also keeping my boundaries (on the very odd chance that part of it might be loss of interest and him up-playing the situation).  I thought he wouldn't reply. But then he bombarded me with many messages thanking me for my concern etc. and saying he's sorry it couldn't work out etc. etc.  I asked one close friend about her interpretation of the situation and she dismissed it as an elaborate ""hit it and quit it"" slow fade situation. She argues that although the family situation is a thing, he would have still messaged here and there if he were truly interested. But I hardly think that is the case? Especially if he is an INTJ? I see it more as: yeah there wasn't like huge interest in a serious relationship yet, we were in the get to know each other stage. So if a family crisis happens, surely that would squash that level of interest.  I know that INTJs are known for moving on, forgetting, and not looking back. But considering these special circumstances, I can't help but wonder whether we could pick up where we left off at some point? How are INTJs normally inclined to see these things? Heck, I'm even tempted to start a friendship with him, as I a) am genuinely concerned about his family situation (but don't know what the boundaries are ) and b) genuinely enjoy the intellectual connection we shared. I just don't know. Should I reach out to him again in a month to check-in?  It's a confusing situation, seeing as we technically only met once but had been getting to know each other for two months before. I really like him. Not only as a romantic connection but also as a person.  I'm an INTP by the way.",Unfinished Business with INTJ

I am a dreamy idealist- I think anything is possible (within reason those ""flying"" pigs still hit the ground at incredible velocity).

I feel emotions very deeply and carefully manage surface level ones. I am not a dramatic person. You can roast me, and I would probably laugh and agree.

They’ll say I’m lacking emotion but I think they’re just lacking logic. Is this a flaw of mine?

1690,intj,"i’m somewhat young but even so I believe i’ve changed in my nature drastically since I was a kid. for example, i’ve recently found myself to be more attentive to my own needs and feelings and become increasingly insensitive to others. for example, I found it more difficult than usual to purchase christmas presents for my family this year as I was just ignorant to what they wanted. it’s not that i’m trying to “not care” about people and forcefully restrict myself from putting myself in their shoes, it’s just that it’s more difficult than it used to be for me. I understand INTJ’s are given this stereotype of being cold and aloof but I suppose it’s not intentional as it’s a result of low Fe. i’m not able to discern if this sensation is just some sort of block in my current life or if it will be continuous as I mature. did anyone else experience this? what are some ways I can increase my Fe?",Unintentional insensitivity

He is very prone to road raging, often gets depressed if he feels he is not acknowledged enough by his friends, etc. He is also generally too much invested into the lives of others and can even get upset via people he doesn't actually know on social media. Not only is his hyper-sensitivity disruptive but its often a danger (especially in the case of road raging).

1703,intj," This guy is a successful salesman - he is successful in part due to his great interpersonal skills (he is charismatic and you sense when speaking to him that he wants to get to know you, even though he is making a sale,) and his ambition (he has always wanted to be financially stable due to wanting to live a gratifying life without having to worry about money - his father often spoke about saving money when he was growing up - and he is partly ambitious due to wanting to help his wife out in providing for their three children. He does not want them to be too spoiled, and knows that his wife works hard in regards to her own job, but understands that it takes two great incomes to maintain their home and help pay for what their kids need. He genuinely cares about his wife and supporting her, as he sees her hard work and partly works so hard in regards to his own job to lend her a helping hand, and to ensure that he is a good role model for his own children.) He always likes to ensure that he knows at least a bit about a product before he tries selling it to be safe/avoid feeling anxious, though he has been able to sell products in the past even when he did not know a great deal about the product due to his aforementioned charisma (he can honestly be a \*bit\* manipulative when selling products, but not in a malicious way in the slightest...)His social skills help him out a great amount in regards to his job as a salesman; he has always been popular amongst groups of people, even going back as far as elementary school - he aimed to be popular in elementary school as he felt in his household that since he was the middle child, his spotlight was stolen by his older brother, or his younger sister. He aimed to be known for being ""cool"" and him being so personable led to him being voted in class president against the richest girl in school. He did enjoy hearing gossip (and still does, honestly,) but does not necessarily partake in it (i.e. he does not really speak negatively about other people unless he dislikes someone - and he is honest about it when he dislikes people, though not too blunt - but he does enjoy hearing about the business of others from friends.) Although he has never been what some would consider to be dumb, he maintained average grades whilst in elementary and middle school due to not having a serious interest in the subject matter - however, since he ended up dating (and later on marrying,) the smartest girl in his grade (he was interested in her due to her being pretty, kind, and finding her intelligence attractive... he liked that she was always helping he and other people out, yet also capable of solving nearly any problem,) he asked her in high school to help him raise his grades, as he understood that he needed to start maintaining higher grades in order to start seriously looking at a career (he also saw his girlfriend succeeding academically and wondered, on some level, why he deserved her. He wanted to be the guy that she deserved to have, or at least this was how he thought of it, and also wanted to help himself out career-wise.)He actually committed to raising his grades with her help, even though it was difficult at first to maintain a consistent studying routine as he always wanted to sit down and relax after school, or head out with some friends. He had always maintained a healthy romantic relationship with her even whilst dating due to being willing to talk out different issues with her (she had to start the conversation, but he was open to it and willing to listen, as he really did want to make things work.) He did end up attending a good school in regards to college due to his dedication, and even though he did care for her, he and his aforementioned girlfriend agreed to break off their relationship for a little while due to attending different schools (he was upset about this, but tried dating two other people in college, as did she... only to find that it didn't ""feel the same"" and that he missed her too much. She would later on report feeling the same.) After graduating, he re-connected with his former girlfriend due to understanding based upon his other two relationship experiences that she was his best match (and hoping that she still felt the same - she did!)He found his first sales job through a social connection (through a buddy of his,) as he ensured that he networked throughout college (partly due to his aspirations, and this was partly natural - he is the kind of person who would have made connections no matter what school he went to,) and although he did have some fun as he learned more about the sales world, he still made sure to take his job seriously, as he knew that he wanted a future with his girlfriend and financial stability. He moved up in the ranks due to his social skills and interest in improving at the job, and married his girlfriend - he, of course, begun to work harder and harder after their kids were born. However, he recalled his own father having been a workaholic, and feeling that he didn't get to know him as well as he could have due to this (and feeling that his father was boring and only ever rambled about money); for this reason, although he makes sure that he establishes boundaries with his kids (he, along with his wife, encourages them to maintain at least average grades in school and undoubtedly parents them,) he still successfully gets to know his children as people and pays attention to them. He has a genuine relationship with each of his children, and even though he can be direct with them at times, is loved by them - he is usually understanding of their feelings, yet does not tolerate disrespect from them toward he or his wife and is clear about this.[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kl0n4t)",What would you assume?

For example, my ENFP roommate randomly threw a huge party with random people smoking and drinking in our apartment without telling me or planning it and I get really mad about it because it was very spontaneous and unexpected of him to do that when I just wanted to go home and relax. One time he even came into my room when I was trying to sleep because I had school the next day and was trying to stay on my schedule and at like 3 AM brought some random dude into my room and jumped on my bed and then turned on the lights and just started laughing, I was pissed off when this happened because again I did not ever expect him to do something like that.  My other friend, an ENTP, and I make plans, and a lot of times we have solid plans made, he completely forgets or just says ""oh, something more interesting came up and I just spontaneously went with that instead"" which surprised me since he told me we would be doing something but ended up just lying to my face which I did not expect. My own mom is an ESTP, and she also does things that I never expected her to do, for example, throwing out my things without asking me first if I needed them, or whipping me with a towel out of the blue just because to her it's fun. Another example of this is that I was trying to start a project with an INTP and ENFP, we all met up and talked about this business idea and I thought since we traveled just to get together to discuss it that we were serious about actually doing it but it turns out they just flaked and changed their mind about things and got caught up with other more interesting things which again I did not expect.

They’re my friends because it just so happens 10% of the things I’m interested in happens to overlap with their interests. Other than that, we’re very different people.I just don’t think I’ve been able to develop a deeper emotional connection with anyone I’ve ever met, and I know other INTJs as well.

I’m alone, and yet in those moments of calm, it doesn’t feel lonely. Despite that, I cannot shun away from the fact that there remains a nagging desire of mine to be around other human beings where I could truly be myself around. I don’t get it. And people apparently form close emotional relationships? How do they do that? How do they create this apparent bridge between themselves and other people?

1730,intj,"Hi, this is going to be a little personal! I broke up with my best friend and first love three years ago. It was his decision;  along the lines of him having been unsure at the time and thinking of me as a 'friend' and also the fact that I wasn't comfortable being physically intimate (despite him communicating that before we started dating and my reasoning). We agreed to stay friends after that, but I always cared for him as more than one and he continued to take advantage of that. Since I graduated and got into college I cut him off;  I could see it was a one-sided friendship and our core values were constantly clashing.  I am commonly not this emotionally irrational, or so stuck over events long gone. And trust me, I have been through far worse and have worked myself through those events in a positive manner. But despite it being have almost a year I can not seem to get over this man. It has made me constantly feel on edge and doubt everything, even the people closest to me and have been isolating myself (something which COVID made worse).

1731,intj,Which fictional character do you relate to most based on current life situations?,Which fictional character from any TV Show or book do you relate to most and why?
1732,intj,"The reason why I have though of that is that I tend to think about such characters from an evolutionary perspective. We, males, have evolved to find some characters attractive because they define females with whom we can replicate our genes, and those characters weren’t “chosen” by nature by random; those exact characters, actually, correspond to fertility. Sometimes, when I’m attracted to someone, my mind says, “nice try! I now know how this works and won’t fall for it.” It’s actually one of the reasons I don’t have a gf. My instincts tempt me to be open to relationships, but my mind depresses the impulse.(For clarification, I am talking from a male’s perspective, but I would have thought in the same way about male characters if I were a female.)","I feel like sexual characters that attract us, males, (long hair, boobs, curvatures) have become old tricks by nature."

I haven't reached my goal but if I did die right now, I could be proud that I tried, however little. I'm still committed to getting what I want out of this life but there's the chance it won't work out. What's your stance? Going to do what you set out to do or no matter the end, it's about the experiences along the way?",The journey is reward?
1734,intj,"There is a lot of debate about Beethoven's type in the nooks of the community that like to waste their time with speculation on long dead folks' type, and many pinpoint him as INFP, based mostly on a few of his (maybe more Fi-tinged) quotes, which are the best known ones, like:&gt;Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy.&gt;Music is indeed the mediator between the spiritual and sensual life.But from the biographies I've read of him, I've long been convinced he was an INTJ.

1738,intj,"I don't know, from my understanding of our personality type, we like being strong on our own and doing things that make us feel safe and secure.  Maybe that's a universal human pursuit, though.I had been thinking about this for a long time.  I am 26, have had a facebook and various other social media accounts since I was about 16, later than my peers I remember.  Expression on these platforms was something I became used to, though social media now is so much bigger than it was 10 years ago!  I struggled with over sharing.  I was in a situation where I didn't have close friends from age 13 (6th grade) onward.  I went through a lot of difficult times, and felt a lot of loneliness that was painful.  I would post personal things on facebook (mostly) to a wide array of people.  People would help, but then I'd feel bad because everyone knew my business.  I just wanted people to know I was still here.  But ultimately it wasn't good for my relationships and others' perception of me.What I learned:  If you are someone who doesn't talk too much and isn't too expressive, and if people don't know what you struggle with, they will ""fill in the blanks"" of your personality with positives, most usually.  They will subconsciously give you the benefit of the doubt.I was going through a lot and needed help.  This last year has shown me how few people I can actually count on for anything, so I decided it was time to thin the herd on social medias.  I went from about 500 facebook friends, to 37.  I unfollowed pretty much everyone on instagram.  I no longer have the anxiety of feeling connected.  And I no longer make posts embarassing myself.  I feel a lot better not seeing updates from people I couldn't give two shits about.In case this is something you're considering, I recommend it.",I deleted everyone I know on social media.

And feel so, disconnected sometimes with people. She would try...so hard...and it felt very fake to me. Of course, now I know, this is who she is. From my readings of an INTJ, she is exactly that. I took it as a negative. She never had GREAT social skills so it didn't help. But it was mainly me not accepting her, not her fault.I resented that emotional coldness during those social situations, probably because I was ignorant of her personality and didn't accept it.

I've done every well-known cognitive function test you can name, asked for outside input from other people in the MBTI community... you get the point.However I noticed I have one very uncommon trait for INTJs that I haven't seen in any other INTJ I've met both online and irl. I enjoy my solitude, I get worn out from work, I'm notoriously bad at talking to people I don't know very well, and I always feel like I need a week to myself after an exhausting day out. However, when I'm with my closest friends and family, I can become h y p e r.  REALLY hyper. When you put me in any setting with the people I'm closest to, my energy alone could match that of a college frat party (obvious exaggeration but I really need a metaphor to imply just how energetic I get). Sometimes these bursts of energy last for only the amount of time that I spend with them, but sometimes this energy can last for days. For example, if I spend a weekend with my friends, I might sometimes feel really antsy the next day, wishing I could go out again. I'm agitated, restless, and it's usually hard for me to focus, sit still, and be productive on these days. This is one of the traits that led me to believe that I was an ISTP for about a year. But once those moments pass, I'm back to my ""normal"" self.","Is this a ""normal"" INTJ thing? Could it have anything to do with inferior Se?"
1744,intj,"For some reason everybody wants to be an INTJ. I’m not really sure why because I don’t believe any personality type to be better or worse than the others but people have made being INTJ a trend like it’s some kind of beauty standard for the MBTI. Here is what I mean when I say that being INTJ is the “beauty standard” of the MBTI world: People who are not INTJ force themselves to believe that they are, and people who are INTJ feel the need to embody and/or exaggerate every single trait provided by less than accurate sources. The most prevalent issue to me is that they perpetuate the narrative that INTJs are unfeeling robots when this is not the case. Personality types do not determine your emotions or lack thereof. If you can’t experience an emotion, then you most likely have a personality disorder (which I would like to state that there is nothing wrong with as these cannot be helped.) MBTI is used in part to explain how we are likely to experience emotions and in turn, how we may handle them or express them, not if we feel emotions at all. Some people here think that certain emotions or mental illnesses are caused by being an INTJ and then there are people who complain about people expressing their emotions and experiences with mental illness because they don’t think it’s INTJ enough. I agree that there should be a separate sub for INTJs looking for advice because in all honesty this sub has become more of a therapy sub than a discussion sub- but who the hell are some of you to tell people who they are based on a few posts they have made? To both of these groups I need you to understand this: correlation does not equal causation. Being INTJ does not cause you to experience these things or not experience these things. How can a group of people who claim to be INTJ be so closed minded?  People on here are trying too hard to fit the INTJ stereotype. I am a firm believer in the MBTI system, but I do not believe that every single person within a specific personality type is going to embody every single trait given. Personality is more dynamic than 4 letters given to you by a test. While the test may be accurate, people do themselves a disservice by underestimating the complexity of personality and the human psyche.  Instead of molding yourself to fit the results of a personality test, let the results fit into the mold of who you are. It’s okay to not check every single box because if you make yourself check every box, then you will embody the results instead of letting the results embody you. Think for yourselves and stop trying to be the heartless, pompous, arrogant know-it-alls that the unreliable sources make us out to be. I don’t understand why anybody would WANT to be any of those things. And stop using being INTJ as an excuse to be an asshole. Your MBTI doesn’t determine if you’re an ass, YOU DO. It’s just shocking to me that as the Architects, so many INTJs on this sub and in general are so willing to follow the herd. Be yourselves. Some of you put too much gravity in being INTJ and that says a lot.",Stop trying to fit the mold.

1747,intj," This girl is determined to win a poetry contest after an incident earlier on in class leads her to believe that she may be coming close to being knocked down as her grade's smartest/most high achieving student (in regards to academic performance, or should I say GPA - another student in class had received a grade higher than hers on a spelling quiz.) She has an obsessive need with needing to be the best, in spite of her parents being supportive (though her father does encourage her to receive good marks.) She is unable to think of anything to write in regards to a poem, or at least anything that may lead to her winning, as whilst she is capable of coming up with creative solutions (or just solutions in general) to problems if asked, she has difficulty writing with true emotional depth in the way some can and is aware of this. She is afraid of ""looking dumb"" because that would prove that she is not actually as smart as people think. She is self aware that she's willingly taken the ""smart one"" role amongst her peers and maintaining that role is a lot of pressure... she is naturally shy and passive by nature, and feels that being smart is what makes her stand out as someone special. Because of this, she plagiarizes the poem (this happens before the age of the Internet,) and does end up winning the poetry contest with the plagiarized poem. She initially tries to justify the cheating to herself in order to ease her guilty conscience after winning... but her guilty conscience leads her to imagine the trophy staring her down, and the trophy talking to her every time she looks at it. She is asked by the principal of the school to read her poem, although she initially intends on confessing when he sits her down. Even though she has this opportunity in front of her, she still feels guilty, and imagines the trophy talking to her. She does sit to herself and say, "" You didn't do the hard work you're capable of. You stole a poem and called yourself a poet. You should have searched deep inside yourself like all real poets do."" The guilt is enough to a point in which she is noticeably upset enough for her parents to notice (her father practices fencing with her,) even though she will not give direct reasoning at the time for her displeasure. On the day in which she is supposed to present the poem, she confesses to her parents a bit earlier, and then confesses to the principal with them in front of her right before it is her turn to go up. She admits that being the best is important to her: "" I'm used to being the best, sir. That's who I am."" When the principal asks her if there is more to who she is than being the best, she states, ""I really don't know, sir."" Who would do this?

1764,intj,She doesn’t give good advice as it’s mainly like“just love urself” “accept it” “smile more”it’s just not funny or amusing and it gets obnoxious.my mom has already said she’s not there to give advice but she more so just exists to cook nice stuff etc.But sometimes like she says really weird stuff like “We intuitives see 1+1 and it means 1000000!”like it’s nonsense but she says it in a good way but it makes me feel like ... that’s exactly why people get annoyed at her because she hasn’t let herself develop properly.

1765,intj," I have a complicated relationship with a INFJ that sometimes I get confused because its so hard to read what he feels about me. We are at a good spot spending quality time together (intimacy, deep conversation) one moment and then he gets cold when we get too comfortable with eachother. I understand he needs his alone time and I definitely give him space. I'm a ENFP and I understand his needs but I just can help from myself from caring about him so much and he knows this. He hasn't really told me how he feels and if I bring it up or ask him he doesn't really say anything and he gets distance with me. We won't text or hangout for a week or 2. Then when he does come back we're back at this cycle. I really care and have crazy feelings for him and I don't want to lose him i just want to know if he acts like this because he might start having feelings for me. I feel like he shows it in his actions and the way he looks at me. Either that or I'm just someone to have sex with but I know theres something more.INFJ are hard to read but definitely easy to love.",Is he falling for me?

1767,intj,"based on quora, apparently INTJ’s and INFJ’s (or INXX types in general) are the two types most likely to be intrigued by MBTI. however, they failed to elaborate on the difference between INTJ and INFJ’s initial reason for that attraction. I would think that INFJ’s would be intrigued because of something correlated to understanding others and themselves better and they would generally have a more long term connection to the theory. however, INTJ’s might be captivated simply because it’s a tool they can utilise to recognise their own strengths and weaknesses to perhaps improve themselves. I have taken an interest in MBTI to better understand myself yet i’ve also found myself externally applying it by giving everyone a four letter label. I especially enjoy typing characters in a movie and then discussing their type with my dad after it’s over. would INTJ’s be enthralled by the humanitarian aspect of this theory that I seem to portray an interest for? or is that more INFJ?",What’s the difference between INTJ and INFJ’s interest in MBTI?

1769,intj,"Just jumping right into it this has been a huge pain point in my life since like forever. I’m pretty sure a weaker person would’ve committed suicide but thank God (and i truly mean that) that I’m an introvert and actually need little to no social interaction. But ever since grade school it seems like people have gone out of their way to conspire against me and make my life miserable.I remember being in highschool, being the shy art kid in the back of the class and having everyone clown on me just for keeping to myself. I was a bit mature for my age to have the forsight to know that they were just being dumb little kids. I never cared for the social hierarchy of High school and thought it was corny af my whole 4 years. After high school i thought that shit was over but almost 6 years later i run into a girl I barely knew in high school (we had PE together i think) and she makes a comment about me being shy as if I’m still that person.. Keep in mind this girl had like one class with me and i never talked to her.. I barely remember the names of classmates i talked to everyday and this woman is holding some grudge against me because i was shy in high school..With that said, the past few days Ive been having the weirdest interactions with absolute strangers more than usual. It doesnt help that I’m a black male living in the Deep South with the current political climate either. I try my best not to associate attitudes i get from people with my race but it seems to be the only thing that makes sense.Just today i was running last minute errands with my family, we went to Office Depot to pick up an order. Some huge middle aged dude (white) looked about 40  was just staring at me like he was crazy. I didnt think much of it as I’m used to this shit by now but my niece noticed and mentioned the dude looked like he wanted to legit kill me. And it wasnt like i did anything I was literally just looking at the laptop display while on the phone.Next stop I’m at a target, this older couple (white) is behind me and my sister inline I’m just standing there minding my own business going through instagram.. We leave the store and my sister is talking about how they were staring me down the whole time..Not to mention the fact that the as soon as i got up to the register the cashier (black dude) avoided eye contact with me and didnt speak to me at all.. No greeting or anything.Next stop the grocery store we’re picking up some last minute ingredients for grandma. I get up to the front of the line, two young girls (black).. Again no greeting or anything... They almost act mad I’m in their line.. I’m just trying to get my shit and go.. The girl checking me out passes a look at the girl that’s bagging. These people ive never met or seen in my life are acting like I just pissed in isle 3 or something.. Stone faced both of them the whole time says nothing to me.. I’m so used to this shit i dont even care so they get no reaction out of me I literally just think theyre acting super dumb and hateful for no reason. I honestly dont understand why this tends to happen to me. At first i thought it was because I stayed in a small town and possibly there was a rumor going around about me but now I feel like people just hate on me for no reason. I was literally just running errands minding my own business on my phone.I know INTJ’s get a lot of hate for being closed off but how can complete strangers in public sense this so quickly? Does anyone else experience this?",People absolutely hate me.. common INTJ experience?

It happens when I walk, talk, listen, anytime really.(This is regardless if it's a subject I like or dislike)On the flip side I also have laser focus when I eventually get my mind on (some) track, then there are no distractions, I will even forget eating because I am so immersed then.

1791,intj,"I live with my ESTP mom and she always tires to tell me what to do when I already know what to do. She gives me suggestions and advice that I never ask for simply because I don't need it. She will critique me for everything that I do without understanding why I do the things that I do and it's really frustrating to have to hear it constantly. She will point out things that I do and make a conclusion about it immediately. For example, I told her that I might not have a job next month because that might be letting employees go and she just says ""you need to apply to jobs!"" It's like she doesn't think that I have the mental capacity to know to get a new job. I explained this several times and told her to stop giving me advice when I don't ask for it and stop telling me what to do because I am 22 and can handle myself. Everytime I try to bring this up and say ""stop giving me advice and telling me things that I already know when I never ask for it in the first place, I have a system of my own that works"" and then she will probably give some snarky and sarcastic remark like ""ohh okay fine, so we just won't have conversations then "" which is not what I was saying at all, all I simply said was ""don't give me suggestions and advice I didn't ask for because it's annoying"" I'm trying to save up money now to move out but I will need to live here for probably another year or so.",How to deal with an ESTP mom who constantly gives unwanted suggestions and advise

1793,intj,"I recently took an mbti test on a different site than normal and I liked it because it had better questions than the previous ones I’ve used. In the past I’ve gotten ISTJ once and INTJ twice. But today I took one and got ENTJ, with extroversion being just slightly higher than introversion. I’ll try to explain my behaviors best I can without typing out an essay.I’d say i’m right in the middle of being an introvert and extrovert. While I definitely enjoy some solitude and isolation, too much of it drives me insane. I’m not a party animal by any means but I enjoy social events occasionally, and this pandemic really sucks as far as lack of social interaction. I exhibit a lot of INTJ thought processes but one huge thing that sets me apart from most is speaking my mind. I don’t always speak my mind 100% but if someone is talking politics for example and says misleading stuff based on emotions or misinformation and I can get extremely heated. In other words I definitely don’t sit quietly and pretend to agree with someone unless it’s a college professor and my grade depends on it. But even then there’s been a couple instances where I spoke out and I could tell the professor got really mad but didn’t show it. So it really depends on the situation as far as when I let my views be known. I can literally debate all day if I have to, I thrive on it. When it comes to emotions, I feel like I have too many outbursts to be an INTJ. I can hold them in for a while but if I reach a breaking point I flip out. When it comes to leadership I definitely display strong leadership qualities when given the chance. But it can be super frustrating if I have to lead stupid people who don’t cooperate and I harp on them until they do their parts because I’d be damned if I’m gonna sink down with them.The future, I do a lot of planning for the future and I always think about all the different potential outcomes of scenarios.

I still stand by that, but things did take a turn today. I thought I'd been abundantly clear about my intentions by asking her out on dates, etc., but for the heck of it I decided to be as clear and direct as possible. I hate texting personal stuff, but that's the only form of communication she and I can agree on right now. So this was our text exchange this afternoon...Me: Hey &lt;insert clever name&gt;, I want the getting to know you stage to lead to a relationship. What do you think? 2020 sucked, but slowly getting to know you is pretty great 😊Her: This year is *tough* but that’s kind of you to say! I have to be honest and tell you I’m not looking for a relationship but I truly value and appreciate your friendship in such a tumultuous timeI did text back after that to thank her for her honesty and say I'd like to continue being friends, etc. However, I am a bit tender right now. I really didn't love myself completely until this year. I started transitioning a decade ago (female to male), but still had body issues related to weight. My weight even led to me having to cancel bottom surgery a couple years back. I'm not mr. athlete but I'm down from 315 lbs to 190 lbs. I don't think I would have ever approached her in February if I hadn't finally liked who I saw in the mirror. So, I'm tender because I really liked her and being this vulnerable and getting this far is so new to me.But I am so grateful for this experience. She is a wonderful woman and I truly hope she finds happiness in life. I hope we can stay friends. I can make my romantic feelings go away once I know they're unrequited, sure, but I still care for her on a deeper level. I want her in my life, in my future, even if it's not in the way I envisioned before. Her friendship is valuable to me.Thank you to all of you beautiful INTJs for your insights and replies!

1805,intj,"You know, as an INTJ, one problem I have with a lot of INTJs is that some of them can be really terrible. Some can be stuck up, snobbish, *always* assume they're right and no one else is, they look down on other people, and they try to use ""logic"" to excuse their horrible behavior. It's also especially terrible when they're like, ""Well, if you like art or wear colors other than black or enjoy physical activities then you're not really an INTJ."" I've got stuff like that before. Like... Seriously. It's almost as if they think the actual cognitive functions have nothing to do with the personality and it's all about the stereotypes. INTJs can like art. INTJs can wear pastels. INTJs can enjoy physical activities. I've done extensive research on the INTJ and the cognitive functions, and there's no doubt that it is my personality type, but I don't really fit the ""mastermind villain"" stereotype. I like art; music, painting, poetry. I wear pastels sometimes, especially during the summer (all black is the worst in the summer where I live, it's so hot). I was a gymnast for most of my life and I still enjoy acrobatics like that (I just suck at sports like basketball and football and anything with a ball being thrown at your face). And while sometimes I act cold and uncaring, I really do care. I like making people happy. It's stupid to use ""logic"" and ""I'm a thinker"" as an excuse to be a terrible person.  Just because someone doesn't fit the stereotype doesn't mean they're not an INTJ.",The Problem With Some INTJs
1806,intj,"I just got off with one of my friends from college. We sometimes talk but aren't mega-close. She offhandedly mentioned I'm sometimes socially inept. Ehhh, I get where she's coming from, but I think that's unfair, or she's basing that from outdated information. Sometimes I unintentionally intimidate people with my confidence and willingness to talk about interesting things, but I don't feel it ever exits ""well meaning"" territory or hurts anybody.I would rather have people decide my personality isn't for them, rather than pretend to get along for sake of fitting in a group.But it does suck when people feel, ""You just don't read the room"".I damn well can read the room, it's just, I'm not always going to agree with it.There's a yin-yang to it. If I were careless and just did my own thing to appear different, then sure, that would be annoying. But I feel I don't do that. Not that I've *never* done that before, but I've grown, and do it less than ever. Like an exponential graph nearing zero over time, but never hitting it.I just wish more people understood that about me.",There's a yin-yang to having a strong personality.
1807,intj,"I’ve been typed INTP for years, but I just started Ritalin a few weeks ago. It has balanced me out and part of me thinks my Ne was just my ADHD, things aren’t as wild now. I have always thought I had a fair amount of Fi too, so INTJ seems to be making more sense, but only when I’m on Ritalin. Any others with ADHD?

1808,intj,"I'm planing to start learning programming, and currently at the stage of going through endless articles and methods on how to do it. I was hoping some of my fellow intjs who are programmers or have some experience with how to go about it, might be kind enough to share with me how they did it? What works and what doesn't? What things to avoid? Where to start?.. etc I thought I might get some customized advice here. Thanks in advance!",Advice with learning programming
1809,intj,"20yo INTJ here in need of life advice.  I feel lost in life.  I just had the monologue that everything is a system within another system.  Didn’t get into university because I never got a 2nd language credit during high-school.  So, what genius idea do I get?  Teach yourself Latin!  I’ve gotten through one year of the dead language and can say that I have the creeping sensation that it was time spent for nought.  Let me accentuate the point...I fear my time has been utterly wasted and can’t shake the irrational feeling that my potential has been wasted as well.It appears to me that I need to move out and get on my own.  Maybe if I live in fear of failure, I’ll succeed more.  What are some practical skills and tools that’ll help set up a more stable tomorrow?  Does the irrational feelings of potential being wasted subside? (Assuming someone resonates with the feeling)How can I live in a system of morals and conduct if I recognize it is just a system made by man?  How do you more successful and older INTJs live?  Is happiness a possibility?  Can someone talk sense to me?I’m sorry if it seems like a rant.  These are my thoughts, and I genuinely feel afflicted.  I need answers to move forward in life.  And for nothing else, this post organized my thoughts for me a bit better.",Assistance Needed

1811,intj,"As we all know INTJs are considered unemotional, but my theory is that we're emotional only for specific people. I experienced that when my gfs friend asked me how can I be so kind to my gf.

1812,intj,,The 3 voices in my head all the day :-
1813,intj,"I don’t want to say it, but I feel like I’m beginning to feel hopeless in our ability to communicate. It always seems we’re discussing something completely different. I get the logic vs emotion dynamic, and I try to keep emotions in mind but to avail. Our latest disagreement surrounds a game. Essentially both parties come up with date ideas and put them in a jar. If you draw a date idea, you’re responsible for organizing it. My wife has been putting chores in the jar (e.g. return amazon packages). I’ve been putting dates (e.g. Go-Karting, fancy restaurants, etc.). Over the weekend, we went on a mini vacation for her birthday and didn’t complete any “dates” the previous week. This is important to understand her perspective. The thing is, as an INTJ, my mind is always improving things and I wanted to make some suggestions on the game rules: 1. the organizer doesn’t reveal the date until the day of, 2. the dates have to be on our joint calendar for visibility (the calendar could just show “Date Night”). She says she doesn’t like the idea. I ask why (of course I do). She says “how would I know what to wear?” I say we could put the dress code in the notes...like yelp. She mentions we haven’t done the ones from the last week.(Granted, I forgot about them with everything going on last week...hence my calendar idea. But it’s not like she mentioned them either.)Anyway, the convo devolves into her complaining about changing things and me saying we don’t have to make any more changes. Let’s leave it as is. This is unacceptable to her and she says we’re changing it but complains some more.So, in instances like this, I don’t know what to do. She’s annoyed and I say we can drop it. She refuses to drop it but still complains.  I insist that bee can drop it if it upsets her. She refuses but continues to complain (like “well, since we’re always changing things...” or “We’ll just redo the entire thing since we’re keep changing things...”This leads to a blow up. I admit I lose my cooI and raise my voice. “Look, we DON’T have to do it. Let’s just keep it as is.”Then all hell breaks loose. So, I’m at my wits end. From what I gather, she wanted to do the “dates” from last week, and since we haven’t done them, then I am dismissing her dates. And my idea for dates to be a surprise ruins her date ideas like doing Amazon returns. And since I really don’t want to do her chores as dates, then I am effectively dismissing her ideas. So we need to redo everything from the ground up.We haven’t really spoken since yesterday. And I’m still here thinking “damn, all I was trying to do was suggest changes to a game we’re coming up with together. WHAT’S WRONG WITH THAT?!”I’ve been thinking of divorce a lot lately (like the last year or so), but I don’t want to.  But sometimes I think both of our lives would be better if we had people that better understood us...",INFJ Wife
1814,intj,"I should preface this by saying that I am 18 and primarily date men between the ages of 18-21. I have become absolutely disillusioned with the process of dating. Due to the pandemic, (and a myriad of other factors), I have resorted to online dating. I recognize that as an INTJ, I am inclined to be critical of others and I try to see past this personal bias. Despite my efforts to connect with men my age, I continuously find them to be shallow, unmotivated, uninteresting and most importantly immature. Quite frankly, I am beyond frustrated. If I do happen to begin speaking with someone semi-regularly, I quickly find that they are either unable or unwilling to carry out any form of intellectual conversation (using intellectual for lack of a better word). There is absolutely no seriousness or depth to any conversation I have had. The dichotomy to this is that if I find a man who is more “intellectually-inclined” he tends to be dismissive or me or aggressive in conversation. I am calling out to my fellow INTJs, more specifically female INTJs, for dating advice. How do I find someone which I am compatible with? Where do these rare breeds hide? As a side note, I also date women, but I find that many of them do not like me (minimal matches with women in comparison to men, despite me “swiping” on them somewhat of an equal amount). Not only do I find that they do not like me, but I find that I do not like them. Either they are as shallow as their male counterparts, or they are physically unappealing.",Dating as a female INTJ
