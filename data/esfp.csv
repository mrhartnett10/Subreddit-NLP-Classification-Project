3,ESFP,"I have seen someone in r/ESTP saying that(i guess ISFJs said it,but,ok,ill continue) they ship ISFJ with ESTP. So,i was sad,cause i personally don't need dating and it isn't in my top 3 interest, and usually i am not interested in ppl and so do they in me,but i would be happy if i,if needed, would find someone with whom i would just naturally do very well.And since my Si dom comrade has one,using the same meachinsm i can use,can i apply it im my life personally?",Are there anyone in romantic relatioship with ISTJs?

8,ESFP,How would you describe an unhealthy/destructive ESFP? I'm very curious if your experience is similar as mine at my worst:),ESFP unhealthy and destructive behaviors?
9,ESFP,"Hey ESFP fam. Feel like mixing it up today and activating my enneagram 8 wing. Here are some pet peeves I have. ü§™* Slow drivers* Being talked at without any interest in my viewpoint. (Unhealthy ‚ÄúBlast‚Äù for any OPS people out there)* tv shows or live sports that interrupt action to share sob stories, and then showing just brief highlights of the action. Ninja Warrior and the Olympics , for example * Micromanagement of trivial things* People who insist that my wife and I are crazy for not owning napkins (maybe have some control of how you eat? üòÜ)* People diagonally and slowly crossing the street in parking lots without acknowledgement of your presence when you let them cross* Cups or mugs (or anything really) right at the edge of a counter or table* People who cough into their hands* ‚ÄúFe‚Äù enthusiasm from people who are actually dying inside... just be real with me. * trying to pack sunglasses. Like... how? They always break.* movies that are weird without any conclusion or point. I like weird... but ya gotta wrap that shit up somehow (here‚Äôs looking at you, Inception)* cliques and group labels * over-apologizing* prioritizing Mother‚Äôs and Father‚Äôs Days over basically anything (‚Äúyou can‚Äôt have your daughter‚Äôs party on her birthday weekend, it is Mother‚Äôs Day!‚Äù)* social media political paragraphs and essays that are clearly just virtue signaling Feel free to add some of your own!

10,ESFP,"So, as we know, ESFP's are kind of known for living in the moment, maybe even a little too much. I don't know if you guys feel this way, and it's kind of pathetic to admit, but my ""living in the present"" is very extreme. Particularly if I'm going through something regarding physical pain. Every time I'm sick, or feel unwell, or get hurt, I constantly have to repeat in my head ""There will be a time and a place when I won't feel like this"" over and over again, because it seems like an impossible task to comprehend the fact that this pain won't last forever. I know it sounds stupid, but it's genuinely what I do. It's not always a bad thing, when something good is happening, I'm truly just there soaking up every wonderful moment of whatever it is. It's just when it's something bad, my mind has a hard time realizing that this pain is only temporary. I don't know, does any of that make sense to my fellow ESFP's? How do non-ESFP's feel? Do they not act like that in the same situations? I find it all very interesting. Let me know your thoughts!",Living in the Moment

I an still primarily a dominant Se, but theoretical concepts don't bore me to death like they say they do to ESFPs.

17,ESFP,"Learning has always been a big part of my life. This has been true from several years and over time, I‚Äôve discovered that many of us approach study and learning in an ineffective way. Most of us read or make notes, but in my experience, the Active Recall technique is simply the most EFFICIENT way to retain information.Active Recall is essentially a 2 step process* Review whatever you‚Äôre learning: Take the time to study the materials* Practice testing yourself to recall the informationIn doing so, we switch from passive learning to actively trying to recall whatever we learned. This will help us move the information from our short-term memory to our long-term memory so that we can easily remember it.I employ Active Recall by using methods like The Feynman Technique and Flashcards to test myself. I explain all of this in depth here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHZ\_\_4JUd8g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHZ__4JUd8g)The greatest advantage of using this technique is in training your brain to repurpose whatever you learn and I highly recommend it.",The Active Recall technique showed me the key to long-term learning and growth

And he isn't quiet so umm? How do I tell the difference? The reason I'm conflicted is because sometimes I am quiet. At school in some classes I can be a class clown and in others I say nothing. Also depending on the people the way I  act is different. I much prefer big groups and am more comfortable being loud in front of them than with 1 or 2 people.And also like ""why am I on reddit"" if I am ESFP?

Every once in a while I would get some sort of idea or a eureka moment where I would believe that the idea would be the way how I'm going to live my life for the rest of my life.Then after a few days have passed, I would reach at a point where that same idea that got me so excited in the first place, that same idea would begin to as if ""hold me down"", and I would feel the need to find a new ""ideas"" to improve myself in order to avoid the exhaustion and tiredness of holding to that same idea. Then, I found a new idea, and the process would start over.This has been a very annoying recurring issue since I was 16. It is really annoying. I remember doing this as early as 10 years old, but not to the point it becomes exhausting and annoying as it is now.Please fellow ESFPs, I need your help and advice...

I absolutely adore you, guys, I think you are amazing and fun, and funny and loving and I couldn't be happier to have one of you as my close friend.She is the soul of the party, apart from being admirably gracious and caring, and I always want her around, and she's usually up for everything but sometimes, when she is far from her home at a place where there's more people than just her most familiar friends, she feels nausea and starts having a very hard time. She does experience that everytime she's anxious. She looks so strong and confident yet she does have a very profound self that disrupts her physically every now and then.When we talk about this she just says it won't change, she really focuses on having a good time  beforehand so she doesn't get nausea and all, but she can't seem to control it and I would really like to help her (we want to go camping and there'll be people she doesn't personally know, and she's doubting to go bc of how she gets but she's also dying to go have fun!)Do any of you experience something like this?

43,ESFP,"I'm working on another post for fictional character types of each of the 16 types. I already did one for ESFP Anime Characters and the other types as well. I'll post my list of the best ESFP Anime Characters down below if your interested. A few example of the best and top ESFP Anime characters on the top of my head are Kuwabara from Yu Yu Hakusho, Brook from One Piece, Majin Buu from DBZ, Knuckle Bine from Hunter x Hunter, and know Ryuji from Persona 5 for video games.My ESFP Anime Characters list last year:[https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFP/comments/hin2mv/esfp\_anime\_characters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFP/comments/hin2mv/esfp_anime_characters/)My ENFP Characters list in comparison since their similar:[https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/hdakhy/enfp\_anime\_characters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/hdakhy/enfp_anime_characters/)But besides anime, what are some great fictional ESFP characters from Live Action series? Tell me a list of some great live action ones, western cartoons and movies and TV shows, and video games even is fine. Often times people get confused a lot between ENFPs and ESFPs and mix up characters a lot which causes debates like with the common ENFP shonen main characters. In my opinion lots of learning of the functions and behaviors I learned a lot of the differences between the two types so I trust my judgement on telling ENFP and ESFP characters apart. So I disagree with an opinion on this common confusion and think a ENFP character is getting confused as ESFP I'll share my opinion on it and explain there Ne and Si they use for evidence.As a good example of my opinion on this for characters. I type Princess Jasmine ESFP from Alladin and I type Ariel ENFP from the Little Mermaid for instance and comparison there. Theres quite a lot ENFPs and NFs in Disney movies which fits the Disney magic vibe and idealism the company shows and imagination and so on. Most people know Disney's image and how it is so I don't need to explain this. As another example, I type Ty Lee ESFP from Avatar and type Aang ENFP for more contrast there. I type Simba ENFP, I type Goofy ESFP regular and from Kingdom Hearts as well. Kirishima is ESFP from My Hero Academia also.Tell me some examples of some ESFP live action characters in movies and TV shows, games, and western cartoons and movies too, mostly live action I'm looking for though since I watch a lot of animation and know most famous animated characters types already so the live action side I'm interested in moreso for this future post I'm gonna make for ESFP characters in other medium.

44,ESFP,"Let‚Äôs face it. Every year, I‚Äôve had a hard time stick with my New Years resolutions. Before I know it, I‚Äôve fallen off the wagon. I‚Äôve learned that the major issue with any resolution or habit is maintaining some level of consistency. This year, I‚Äôm taking this into my own hands by following the Don‚Äôt Break the Chain Method. It goes like this:* Every day, mark an X on your calendar if you‚Äôve stuck with your resolution that day.* Over time, each day will turn into weeks and months of Xs* Your goal is to try and not break the chain of Xs\*Note: You can perform variations of the habit which will certainly count as an X.

69,ESFP,"I believe ESFPs do not get enough love online, so I, an INFJ, am here to express my appreciation for them. (I only know two ESFPs in real life, one is my best girl friend and another is a older peer I really admire, so I have had positive experiences with this type).1. I am just so IN LOVE with your go-getter attitude and work ethic.- The ESFPs I know do not wait for good things to come to them, they work and grind for what they want. Whether it's for their dream grad school, their dream job, or someone they want to be with, they make concrete steps in moment to push themselves closer to that goal.2. You guys are such a joy and wild child at parties and in general- The stereotype is that ESFPs are partiers, but it's not emphasized enough how TRULY fun they are when it's time to let loose. As an introvert, I really loved having a friend that I could go out with and feel comfortable to go wild with. They're great dancers and singers, and generally know how to have a good time and a few laughs.3. Great listeners!- If you're in a conversation with an ESFP, they hear and actively listen to what you say. I always felt heard, and comfortable talking to them, because I know they will actually consider what I say.4. Underrated wisdom and advice- That said, I feel ESFPs are underrated with how actually wise they are. Sure in some situations, they may screw up a bit or not really see the underlying issue. But for an INFJ, their take-aways on life and their own philosophies are extremely beneficial to anxious and melancholic Ni Doms.5. Amazing style and eye for aesthetics- Fashion icons, great taste, modern but not boring6. Great bodies and admirable commitment to exercise- Only reason I am comfortable enough messing around in the gym is because of my ESFP best friend. Pushed me to stick to a routine, look exercises up, and in general just have fun with moving.7. Extremely smart and competent at their field of choice- Also not talked about enough, but the ESFPs I know are /experts/ at in what they choose to do. They have a structured knowledge on the subject, and are able to act from there. On top of their consistent energy for work, there is not much they cannot do.8. Surprisingly non-conventional- I feel almost guilty for thinking this, but at first glance I judged them to be very basic. But just because they were very peppy and knew how to navigate people/life, does not mean they are any less unique. Their interests and life paths are not so typical, and they have a very unique mind.9. EXTREMELY loyal to their family, close friends, and significant other- ESFPs get a lot of flack for cheating and being drawn to others because they're just so attractive and smooth, but these people are COMMITTED when they're committed. They also stand by their closest friends, and stick to their families.10. Literally the most generous people- I am always eating, wearing, or using things my ESFPs have offered to me. They never see it as transactional, its just generosity for generosity's sake.11. Unexpectedly amazing leaders for their communities- When their people skills are combined with their knowledge on how things work, they are able to guide, lead, and organize the general public for greater goals.12. Very relaxed about differences- Literally so chill about other people's quirks, unless it crosses a boundary or value they hold close to their heart13. Exceptionally observant- Ni Doms SUCK at this so much, idk why it's a stereotype that INFJs can read people well (maybe if we know the person or place like the back of our hand). But ESFPs are so skilled at noting tiny variations in a person's behavior, able to read if they're angry, nervous, or in love. It's always my ESFP that's reading me or reading for me.14. Very confident, yet humble and modest- They know they're worth and they are not afraid to work for what they want, but they never have an air of arrogance or excessive pride.15. Just great people overall- Happy or sad, rain or shine, just wonderful people to hang out and bond with. Good vibes and great friends only gang :)",Some Love for ESFPs

81,ESFP,"What personality type am i? (I think i am enfp, esfp or infp)Hi, I'm taken such a personality test a couple of times. then I got infp, enfp and esfp.I am a very creative person who loves people. I love to make people laugh. but I also like to be for myself. so I will say I am an ambivert.I have mostly received enfp but do not feel I fit an enfp. i think i'm more of an infp or esfp. is in a way a mixture.at school I have many friends but do not do so well at school. the school system somehow does not quite suit me. and I love and tend to push the boundaries and talk in class and stuff until I get thrown in the hallway or get detention.I am a very sympathetic person and a very sensitive boy. who always thinks of others before I think of myself.I am also very spontaneous and rarely or almost never think about things.I love to think deeply and listen to the poetry poems of Jim Morrison. but it's a secret because i'm a coward to be afraid of getting what others think about me.on weekdays I spend a lot of time with friends but on weekends and holidays I tend to sit inside playing guitar and write my own songs. but to go to party once in a while but it does not happen so often.I'm also pretty shy among new people.

86,ESFP,"Hey guys! I can't decide between ESFP and ESTP cause I really can't decide between Feeling and Thinking, it's a very close tie. I already posted the same text on ESTP Teddit but I would really appreciate it, if you can spend some time reading random facts about me and say of it sounds like you. Thanks in advance üòä‚ô• Oh and sorry for any mistakes, english isn't my first language - I am a very open person, make friends very easily, can socialise with everyone, but prefer to talk to my friends at parties because all smalltalks are the same and dumb- I am a very emotional and sensitive person, but I don't like to talk about my feelings, I keep my face in public - I am not very empathic, it's difficult for me to provide emotional support cause I prefer to solve the problem instead. But I cry watching almost every movie because of the sad music or I can cry because my new plant is dead. - I hate people who have to think for too long while deciding on smth, to discuss the same thing over and over again, cause I prefer to quickly make a decision and act and I don't care if this is the best one or not- I am impatient and restless, if I doesn't understand something right away, then I drop the case. Especially if it's about understanding some complicated theories (I work in sciences so I have to read a lot of theoretical stuff)  - I am good at solving problems of other people, I can remain calm in a stressful situation- I can be rude unconsciously, I try to act friendly and nice towards everyone but it happens sometimes. If I know that I have offended someone, this worries me a lot (exception: I don't like this person, then I don't care lol) - My opinion about my own morality depends on someone else's assessment, if I receive negative feedback and criticism, I consider myself as a bad person and can fall into tears. It's also very easy to manipulate me by making me feel bad, it's hard to say ""no"" in that cases- I can't stand people trying to show how special and individualistic they are.   - I try to be tolerant and accept any point of view, even if it contradicts my principles and logic.  I think that everything on this planet is very subjective, so even if something is the dumbest thing in my eyes, everyone has a right on their own opinion- But this doesn't stop me from provoking  discussions just by taking sides with some very controversial opinions. I just enjoy arguing (although I am not good at it and I am a bad looser who gets emotional)  - I don't believe in mysticism and spiritual things, but I think a lot about the meaning of life and purpose of humanity- I dislike breaking rules and make sure others don't break them too- I am NOT into any sports, it's just too exhausting. I don't like risks and anything ""extreme"". But I enjoy playing guitar and have many handcrafting hobbies- Sometimes (and mainly on the internet) I like to pretend I am dumb cute fairy girl just to be liked üßö‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","Does this sound like you, like ESFP?"

95,ESFP,"Hey! Sorry if these questions have been answered a thousand times, I'm fairly new to mbti and haven't engaged much with the community. I know that 16p mistypes people often but I'm not that deep to know which types and to what so I'm wondering if ESFPs getting ENFP is a common occurrence.The thing is I'm trying to type my sister who had only really taken 16p before (several times, always the same result, ENFP) and just trusted it as the description there seemed to fit her. However, I had my suspicions she had been mistyped because I thought she was too down to earth and practical to be an intuitive, so I helped her figure out her type through the cognitive functions instead. Turns out she's probably an ESFP, with the most defining factor being that her Se is pretty strong as opposed to Si. For example, she's very good at noticing details in her environment and reading people. Besides, she admitted to not feel very strongly towards Ne, even if Ni didn't cause much of a reaction either (which, if it's used as an inferior function, could make sense)The problem is that she doesn't relate as much to most ESFP definitions because they seem ""too exaggerated"" for her, especially the part about being super outgoing, fun-loving and such. I still think she might be one and that her reluctance is due to the fact that she's actually a bit of an ambivert and almost shy. Any ESFP here feels the same way? Most of the other stuff is spot on for her, but a lot of ExFP characteristics are similar so it could go both ways tbh.The second part of the question is that I couldn't help but notice that ESFPs and INTPs (my own type) are pretty much opposites when it comes to functions and I found it really amusing. I always thought we get along pretty well despite our differences in key moments (maybe she gets irritated when I get too logical or sidetracked, maybe I find her too impulsive sometimes, that's about all of it), but I assume it's a tough combination when it doesn't involve people literally raised together. Do you find us annoying in general or it's not that bad?","Possible ESFP mistyped as ENFP in 16 Personalities, what do you think? And would you say ESFPs can get along with INTPs?"

One was creating a discord server with all 16 types (my own idea and I've not seen somebody else do this before me)Create a youtube channel with either all XNTX types or to be different all XNXP types. So I just have this thought what if we combine them and have a youtube channel with 16 types. This would mean a balanced perspective from all the types. Types like ESTJ ISTJ  and ESFP will achually get recognised for once as most mbti YouTube channels are just run by INXP or INXJs or at most ENXPs. It will be intresting to see how the 16 types work together setting up the foundations off the channel Different types will take on different role while setting it up. This dosnt mean IXFP cant be a leader or a Perciever can organise the channel but I think there are different roles that will suit different type better. All types will be on at some point especially when we are making a video about that specific type or that group off type however only some not sure how many will for videos not related for a certain type. We will probably have a discord invent new typing methods and build a website in the futureI'd prefer most people on it to be 15-18 so please tell me your age.

She was also lazy; she enjoyed having fun, never did chores, and never studied for tests in school but she did pay careful attention to whatever was being taught and always did well. She was rebellious, doing things like stealing fruits from neighbors and sneaking out of the home to hang out with friends.¬∑ Friendly, charming, easygoing, energetic, funny, playful, cheerful, childish, outgoing, flamboyant, positive, and far from a serious person¬∑ A few things she judges and hates most in people are those who are lazy and weak. She often says she can‚Äôt stand pushovers because people should just be straight-up about things they don‚Äôt like. ¬∑ She‚Äôs good with her hands and has a lot of skills in things like sewing and cooking. She‚Äôs also really quick to spot things in the environment like finding our parked car.¬∑ She‚Äôs very fickle; she always changes her mind especially at the last second, can‚Äôt commit, changes jobs every few weeks to months, and makes spontaneous decisions like randomly buying plane tickets to visit her home country for vacation. ¬∑ Strong, aggressive to get what she wants, and confrontational. When she wants something, she‚Äôll be determined to go after it. She‚Äôs also not one to give up easily and when someone does something she disagrees with or crosses her, she‚Äôll always confront them. ¬∑ Can get competitive when gaming, is independent, and loves being the leader or the one in charge. She‚Äôs in charge of my dad and she cut ties with another friend when she was young because they both wanted to be in charge of each other. ¬∑ Enjoys learning about health, finances, and investments. She reads a lot of health books and listens to podcasts educating people about improving their finances and basically how to be money smart. ¬∑ Confident, stubborn, and opinionated. She always thinks she‚Äôs right even if evidence is presented to her that claims otherwise. She still disagrees and refuses to budge because she believes she‚Äôs right from ‚Äúher own logic‚Äù. She also jumps to conclusions quickly.¬∑ She‚Äôs saving with money because she stresses the importance of having to save for the future and for emergency situations. Financial security is important to her. She always talks about how her children must plan for their future to be successful.¬∑ Despite telling children they have to plan for their future, she‚Äôs not much of a planner herself. ¬∑ She doesn‚Äôt typically follow rules and prefers to do things her own way. Even with cooking, she doesn‚Äôt listen to recipes even though she enjoys cooking up new dishes. She never gives an estimate of time because she claims ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no such time‚Äù and she enjoys making things by her own ‚Äúideas‚Äù.¬∑ She doesn‚Äôt care much to tell other people what to do; however, she‚Äôs extremely controlling when it comes to her children and has an issue if they don‚Äôt do things her way.¬∑ Tends to do things really quickly, is impatient, always loses family‚Äôs possessions, and frequently misplaces items. ¬∑ Can be quite insensitive and blunt. She‚Äôs also not understanding of people who are driven by emotions and can‚Äôt relate to them.¬∑ Although she can‚Äôt stand people who do things using their emotions, she can also be dramatic. When angry, she has claimed things like how she‚Äôs going to fly away from the country, divorce our dad, never speak to someone again, etc. She also once sold the family business during an argument with our dad because he dared her to, thinking she wasn‚Äôt bold enough to actually do it.¬∑ Can be lazy to start a task but refuses to take a break when she‚Äôs in the middle of a task because once she starts, she can‚Äôt stop even if that means she‚Äôs getting tired¬∑ Some of her hobbies include cooking, watching dramas and comedies, grocery shopping, trying out new recipes, singing, and competitive gaming.","Is she ESFP, ESTP, or something else?"

142,ESFP,"So I‚Äôm wondering if y‚Äôall can relate. I started to think about this a lot since getting out of an unhealthy relationship. So I care a lot about how I look (maybe too much sometimes) and naturally put a lot of effort into my image. Beauty and aesthetics have always been very important to me, which I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall can understand! Anyway, I do want people to be attracted to me physically, appreciate my style, etc. However, when I start to hear too much of the same message, it starts to give me anxiety that people are only valuing me on a surface level. My ex and I were dating long distance for 8 months. When visiting her, I was continuing to be introduced to more and more of her friends. This was interesting. Nothing ever went too deep with them, but our conversations were engaging, and I always felt like I‚Äôd made a good impression. Long story short, while texting my ex one night, she told me that her friends had been calling me ‚Äúhot (my name)‚Äù, which she apparently had no involvement in. My ex would also compliment me a lot on my looks, very seldom about my character. I guess I can understand the frustrations of girls getting cat called, because I‚Äôve had people stop me in the grocery store to let me know their thoughts about my body, call out to me while on a run, and even have my sister‚Äôs friend climb into bed with me without me asking. I know ESFPs are sometimes called the attractive type, and I get it, but I‚Äôm starting to get so sick of the superficiality. Am I the only one who struggles with this? Getting sick of feeling used by people.",Do y‚Äôall ever get sick of being told you‚Äôre attractive?

I looked up the definition of slow learner and it's basically everyone with an iq of 80-90 (dumb, but not dumb enough for mental retardation) ... I am always bad ah stuff like maths.. from 7th to 12th grade math was the hardest shit i know of. I remember leaving the tests blank and got 7/40 questions right on the finals. It never clicked.. I remember getting bullied at 7th grade for being slow and dumb by the smart kids. i was extremely passive at school and had no interest in anything academic. I always rank last each year in terms of overall report card score.  At 8th grade people criticised me for being obnoxious and cheesy... But at that point i was trying to regain my social life after a year of being bullied/as the recluse.  I didn't know how to behave. I remained a recluse after that until 12th grade. Some infp decided to be my pity friend but even he got tired of me being too loud , unfocused, obnoxious, and distracting. He even told me i was trashy. I was merely trying to be sociable, by incorporating trends and pop culture into my persona.  He left me and now i have no friends. I also tried chatting with the opposite sex but the entire class reported me to the school council for ""harassing  them"" all i did was chat with them frequently....

It‚Äôs sort of natural for me to give that to friends etc. I didn‚Äôt mind giving that to him at all. His company was enjoyable. There was physical chemistry. We had casually dated in the past. He kept coming back. However, there came a point where I felt he wasn‚Äôt being genuine or honest once I found out some things he was hiding - which for myself, ISTP is where a person starts messing with my freedom/autonomy because I take that as manipulating information to alter my choice - altering my freedom. I will respect and accept you - but don‚Äôt try to game me. At this point, I bailed. His behavior became a bit cold to me. But basically, I didn‚Äôt find his actions and words to be in synch and yet once the smoke cleared and I asked him why he wasn‚Äôt honest. He told me that he knew I never would have dated him if he told me the truth. Which he has a point.Idk. Is this normal? Or is this a douche esfp?

239,ESFP,"Productivity can often be over complicated. When in fact, the most efficient productivity approaches are super simple. There are very few methods as simple and effective as the Ivy Lee Method, which is over 100 years old. It‚Äôs essentially a 5 step process that looks like this:1. At the end of each day, write down the 6 most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow2. Prioritize the 6 items in order of true importance3. The next day, concentrate only on the first task until completed. Then, move the next task.4. Work your way through your list. Any unfinished items move on to the next day with a new list of 6 tasks.5. Repeat this process each working daySo often our propensity for following some elaborate technique can inhibit our ability to be truly productive. This method simply relies on creating a to-do list with a fixed number of items and approaching it in a smart way.

The sex (I have to compliment you ESFPs, tip of my hat too) was phenomenal, and she even said it was one of the best of her life.  &amp;#x200B;I got mad/anxious when she didn't respond to my texts so I threatened to tell her super conservative/religious family what she does for money. She freaked out and begged me not to, and we talked on the phone from around midnight to 6am while she was crying, but I had assured her I wouldn't do what I threatened.  Couple days later, I ask to see her, and she was being really paranoid and asking me why she could trust meeting me and how she could know I wasn't going to kill her. I was so shocked because I obviously don't want to physically hurt her, but I didn't know what to say, and just got angry again. I stupidly made the same threat to contact her parents and she ended up telling them herself. After that she threatened to call the police etc. and since then I've pretty much left her alone.&amp;#x200B;I've sent her a long apology text but she again told me to leave her and anyone she knows alone.

262,ESFP,"No matter how I looked at my past, there Always was in me this deep hate for the utter simpleness of my peers hapiness. They could laugh 10 min and make jokes about how the teacher missed 1 stair  going to class. And I was Always cynical about it. There was Always this voice saying : ""That's so stupid, it's not even funny and it's been 10minute. STFU already and work on your exercizes or you'll complain again how you didn't passed but spent all class laughing about a stupid joke"".I refused to be happy because I thought it would make me stupid. And yes I wasn't, I was Always a Straight A student. But I became bitter about people over time, bitter at how happy they were and how little they did to improve when I percieved myself as being the ""hero"" by ""sacrificing"" his happiness to be the best. I was a hard working person taking pride in my results but also in my .... unhappiness ??? I was happy that I wasn't happy because I made the association that being unhappy was a sign of hard work. Hard working people are working this hard because they're unhappy about their situation and doing everything they Can to better it. I assumed that because when people's life is on the Line they took thing more seriously, I should engineer my life to make it seem like m'y life was on the line 24/7 and work as hard as I could to better my situation.This came from a lot of observations of my peers. In fact I realized that most straight A students were like me. They weren't happy in the now but planning their life overtime and making sacrifices. The only difference is that they took it to a bearable level, when I was applying to basically all my life. I had so much hatred and jealousy I guess. So much anger that everyone around me was happy but I wasn't. So angry that even thought I was working my hardest, life didn't improve. In fact it was getting worse and worse over time.I was an anti-conformists and had so much anger that I was scared by myself. I treated myself badly for wanting happiness and I was highly judgemental. On the outside I was just a cool dude very laid back who wasn't very demanding about friendship. I appeared wise and deep and smart on first looks. Someone with his priorities in life who's very reliable, not emotionaly draining, chill. But when people were getting closer to me, they started to realize that it wasn't the case, it was all appearance, but I was clueless like they were, if not more clueless than them.When I realized that friendship led to delusion I refused to socialize, refusing to let people get close to me. I wanted to maintain this appearance of thoughtfullness because it flattered my ego. For once I was recognized for my smartness, my knowledge. Even thought I had the emotional maturity of a toddler from not socializing and refusing hapiness.People came to me because I seemed happy, seemed like I had it all figured it out and I could maybe share my secret to find personal happiness. And I took pride in it so I entertained the myth. But this kept me from actually wisening up. Having my opinions changed and experiecing life. I was coming from a position of superiority when I was equal to my peers.Eventually, my peers experienced life when I was pretending, and now I'm too ashamed to admit that I was the stupid one all along.So I bottle up untill I Land my master's degree  and leave the house and the close Friends and go on vacations to catch up. Allow myself to be happy for once and Come back energized and enthusiastic with ""true"" life experiences.This realization was made thanks to my ESFP friend. Because ESFP place a lot of importance on protecting ""good vibes"". ESFP's friend sayings :Treating yourself badly will make you treat people close to you badly.You're more likely to treat yourself badly when you're in a Bad place. Thus you're more likely to be an asshole toward close people when in a Bad place.TL;DR : Be happy and you'll be naturally be nice to everyone around you. You won't expect a dime from your kind gestures and people will love how good you are to them. With one exception for love, were your SO's happiness is more important than yours.when I was in this phase i Saw it as a threat to my work ethics, but didn't realized at the Time that it made me bitter and a Bad person. Didn't made me realize that I was becoming an asshole and snobby to my Friends (except him whom I Always kept in high regards. I Always felt like his equal so my attitude never took a toll on our relationships thankfully)I didn't realized that it kept me from experiencing love with the opposite sex and to experience life. I thought it was a necessary sacrifice but it wasn't.I think a good explanation behind it was my upbringing. I was brought by muslims parents with 80% of Muslim Friends. I went to Muslim School from 6 to 16 years old, do the ramadan and went to mosquee every friday. I was CONSTANTLY told that everything we do in this World will have an impact on our futur life. Wether we will go to heaven or hell. We should Always think about next life and keep ourselves from temporary pleasures (sins on earth) to find eternal happiness in heaven. We never really talked about it because our Muslim School was mixed, we had girls and boys. But sex was evil. It was a taboo, but we all knew that we shouldn't have girlfriends/boyfriends. Those are only for the non believers. And we shouldn't have sex as well untill marriage. We couldn't behave like non believers and take examples in their lifestyles because they didn't know the ""truth"" and were sinners. We could make friendship with them but it shouldn't affect our faith. since I Always was a good student, I took pride in my faith and my dedication again. But even student of said School were not involved in their beliefs. They had this sort of double life were at Muslim school they were believers but outside they weren't. Wherease I was committed in my lifestyle all the way through. Thankfully I had many Muslim Friends in my neighbourhood but again they all had this half-in half-out lifestyle. It was hard to keep up and there were so much contradictions. Like they would go to the mosquee with me Friday morning and do one night stands and party with alcohol and stuff the night. I get it thought. Not everyone is perfect and everyone has flaws, but being this blatantly inconsistent should somewhat distrub you. Because it sure did distrubed me.To this day I'm still Lost. But part of me think is because I live in this inconsistent settings. There are no rules, no consistency. This makes it very difficult to see the benefits but very easy to see the disadvantages. I can't party and have a girlfriend but I can't also have Muslim Friends my age outside of mosquee because I'm not ""cool"", I don't go out and party.The biggest one is having this distance beetween Muslim and non Muslim. I thought of religion as a communitary thing but it's highly divisive.Same with teachers that praises hard work and good attitude in class when your peers condemn focus and dedication.

Our relationship is somewhat  perfect as of now and she everything I ever wanted in a girl. She always text to check up on me ( even before our relationship), she would always pay for food and drinks when we would got out, always makes sure I keep in contact with my parents, we never argue, I make laugh everyday. She is just always there for me in every way imaginable as I am for her. The only thing that I am somewhat trying to get use to is this open relationship thing to which is what we initially agreed on at the beginning at her request. She wants it because she‚Äôs still young and wants to live her life but still loves and wants to be with me. Even sees us eventually having a more seriously relationship together once she gets it all out. I kinda still want to fool around too but I‚Äôm almost 30 and kinda feel like I‚Äôm over that life so it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm waiting for her to take us more seriously.

This is formula that you have to bear in mind:After \[CURRENT HABIT\],I will \[NEW Habit\]You‚Äôre essentially taking your willpower out of the equation by following a routine of practices, and can even have stacks on top of stack, If you prefer. It leveraged the power of using a routine to add on new habits and follow it through muscle memory. For example:After I wake up in the morning, I meditate for 15 minute.After I meditate for 15 minutes, I workout for an hour.After I workout for an hour, I handle email and other tasks.This has even been discussed by James Clear in his bestseller *Atomic Habits* and explains that this is a great way of tapping into the way that our neurons and brain in programmed.

And eventually it builds up over time until he reaches a breaking point because I didn't get the hint.

We thought MBTI could fix a few problems with current dating apps.For one, you are recommended people you‚Äôre statistically likely to love and understand effortlessly, instead of being forced to meet every single type of person. Second, you can save time, money, and emotional fatigue you would have spent on bad dates with no chemistry on other dating apps. Third, you can deeply understand each other‚Äôs personalities before you meet and in a way that was never possible before. And fourth, get in-depth dating advice and insight into how to attract and get along with anyone.[Boo Telepathy Demo](https://i.redd.it/byg6ef7scvs51.gif)Many of our users are using the app to make friends and foster deeper, more meaningful connections. We pretty much built this app for people like us, so I'd love to get your feedback on how we can make it better.The app is completely free to use, with added features like Dating Telepathy that are part of a premium membership (to support our operations).You can download the app through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store links on our website: [https://boo.dating](https://boo.dating/)Thanks!

It can be a location, time, emotional state, etc.* Routine: The behavior you wish to change or reinforce.* Reward: The aftermath of the routine that causes to to revisit that habit in the future.Through my experience, I‚Äôve learnt that it‚Äôs most effective to stick with the same cue and reward and simply manipulate the routine to produce the same result.The key is to really pay attention to the cues that cause you to engage in the habit and then see if you can get the same reward by altering your routine for a better one. I explain this further here with examples - [https://youtu.be/bUtLiAu5rYc](https://youtu.be/bUtLiAu5rYc).

I have assumed this, Since none of them have taken an officially administered one So I had to use people who have gotten theirs officially tested or as close to their range as reference point and from there it was just trying rearrange them by their reasoning ability and ‚Äúvibe‚Äù to determine and arrange their intelligence Another trend I‚Äôve noticed is those ESFP who are 115+ are in touch with their Ni and these people are more reserved than the archetypal ESFP and are most likely to mistype as IntuitiveSe+Ni LARPS something petty similar to NeThis also applies for a close buddy of mine who is an ESTJ who is VERY in touch with his Ne and has scored 128 on Mensa Norway.

You start out with all the right intentions, but somewhere along the line, the commitment to follow through disappears. Elastic Habits showed me that habit formation is more than just a binary approach.Through Elastic Habits, I‚Äôve been able to split my habits into a 3x3 grid of varying intensities by incorporating the following into my approach:* Lateral Flexibility: A variety of ways to approach a habit. (So ‚ÄúExercise‚Äù could be a walk outside OR pushups at home OR a session at the gym.* Vertical Flexibility: Different quantities that you would do. (So 5 minutes or 5 pushups)**The truth is that if flexibility is a core piece of your strategy, then you can bend your habits and goals according to what suits you best that day.**I also use color post-its to track my habit so I can visualize my version of consistency everyday. The main thing is to stay consistent in same way for that habit to stick. I explain this further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFmzRSmDzcE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFmzRSmDzcE) .

372,ESFP,"The Se function, while having the letter ""E"",  simply means having a proactive attitude towards seeking qualities of experience and information in the world.  It has nothing to do with being socially outgoing or being an 'extrovert' in the colloquial sense (recharging around others). Too many people conflate ""extroverted sensing"" or ""E"" with ""extrovert"" and call it a day. I'd imagine many people shy away from considering ESFP as their type due to the stereotypes and this idea that introverts can't be ESFP or that ESFPs don't like abstract thinking because Ni is repressed (false).   The fact is, there are many variants of ESFP and some of these can be quite heavy in Fi or Ni. ESFP represents Gamma first and foremost (the best quadra!), with Pe being our primary function (exploration). We share similar values and themes with Gammas, and share our mode of operation with the other ExxPs. But socially we can be anything, an extrovert or an introvert.","The letter ""E"" does not mean 'extrovert'"

The kind that don‚Äôt wanna take risks, leave their comfort zone etc. What‚Äôs a comfort zone anyway? So yeah I tend to have a conflicting relationship with strong Si users. I guess that‚Äôs my definition of a nemesis- Critic: Fe = good old folks who wanna tell me how I should feel about things. There‚Äôs a lot of hypocrisy and virtue signaling but it‚Äôs not a nemesis relationship and I think it‚Äôs not as strong a conflict as Se/Si. Like I can learn from them but I‚Äôm quick to criticize whenever I deem their Fe as inappropriate.- Trickster: Ti = when you‚Äôre hearing something new from someone else and they kinda back it up with some sort of evidence and you go Se/Te mode and totally don‚Äôt use internal logic to challenge it. God I‚Äôve done that so many times ‚Äúwe‚Äôre herbivores! Wait no we‚Äôre carnivores! that loner on the internet said something it must be true! Watch me reinvent the wheel!‚Äù. TJ users for instance will have much more skepticism of anything that challenges conventional thinking (which may make them too conservative?). I think it‚Äôs not as bad for us as it is for NFPs as we would obviously stop believing in nonsense when it fails miserably in real life applications?- Demon: Ne = I guess the term ‚Äúvaporware‚Äù is appropriate. Fun part is I used to enjoy fictive stuff as a teenager, Tolkien worlds and whatnot. Not anymore tho.

392,ESFP,"I‚Äôm not too sure if I‚Äôm an ESFP or an ENFP because I find that I exhibit characteristics of both  1. I am not aware of my surroundings much at all and often do end up being lost in my thoughts and becoming easily distracted. Also while I am terrible at remembering names I am good at detecting changes in people (e.g new haircut etc) 2. I am really good at understanding people and their motives but I usually do it by reading their body language with some speculation mixed in. 3. I have really good reflexes but have poor hand eye coordination. I usually find that I‚Äôm one of the first to react to a scenario but would not be first choice on a sports team. I‚Äôm also quite clumsy and always found voice acting easier than regular drama because I‚Äôm not too good at moving on stage 4. I am somewhat practical - I don‚Äôt like discussing philosophy for a long time because I don‚Äôt see the point (though I‚Äôm sure there is one) of going on for hours about something that doesn‚Äôt have an answer or help me in my daily life but am happy to have the occasional conversation. I think I enjoy small talk but more importantly I love understanding what makes people tick, especially the closed off ones! I also love murder mysteries :) I find that my sister (ISFJ) is much more practical and grounded than I am but I do often find my NT friends to not really be that in touch with reality, actual practical reality. I did get really friendly with one INFJ guy, and omg trying to understand him was equal parts amazing and frustrating. I felt he was so much more idealistic than me, he looked at the world, saw that it was shit but still wanted it to be better. Whereas I look at the world, see that it‚Äôs shit and go OK, but here are it‚Äôs good parts and opportunities, how can I take advantage of that? My point being that, I‚Äôm not too sure if I lean more towards the intuition or sensing side. I also have an ENFP male friend, who I felt also had a lot of pie in the sky ideas and grand perceptions of himself but I felt reality was quite different and is follow through was a bit weak. 5. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself to be highly fashionable and for the longest time, I didn‚Äôt even care much about my appearance. It was only once I started working in corporate I realised the importance of dressing well, particularly in client facing roles so I‚Äôve been putting in a bit more effort but I‚Äôve still got a loooong way to go.

Both Fi and Se can be effectivly under strong use both in either Dominant and Auxiliary position and sometimes It's very easy confuse.  So I want to know if you guys relate to this description;  to escape stress, I indulge myself in activities that connecte me to reality, such as going outside to the nature or beach, trying to immerse myself in a fun and interesting activity, and overall relaxing or trying find a time to enjoy tasty food at the Restaurant.  I would love to learn to assert myself more efficiently, without appearing childishly stupid to others, in a way that would draw inspiration to others, rather. I wish people would appreciate me, instead of telling me off to ""Grow up"", which I take offense in this, because it always makes me feel like I am not perfect to others for oblivious reason.  I overall fear the future, I do not want to approach the future, mainly because I dont want to age up and become old, losing my physicality, my young beauty, and ability to experience being in the moment to the fullest. I overall hate thinking about the future, and most of the time I just feel nostalgia to the past, but always and foremost, my importance is to embrace living in the moment, being lively, enjoy beauty, nature, the lively atmosphere in cities, competition, being with your friend(s), cool activities, afterall, this is what only matters to me.  Unfortunately, I dont leave th house often, because I dont have much social activities available to me to go to that would entertain me. I usualy go outside like 2 or 3 times per week for 2 hours around to enjoy those listed activties I previously mentioned, and thats all, unfortunately I'm not a fan of just going outside mindlessly without any interesting activity or just anything interesting.&amp;#x200B;I also have a question regarding enneagram.

403,ESFP,,Title
404,ESFP,"\- Always speaks her mind when she has a problem with something. For example, a girl in our table kept accidentally interrupting her. She sassily confronted her saying, ‚ÄúGirl are you gonna let me talk or nah? You keep interrupting me every few seconds.‚Äù The same girl was also eating a lot of the gummy bears my friend brought to class. My friend then said, ‚ÄúHide the gummy bears because if you don‚Äôt, she‚Äôll eat them all by the time we get back‚Äù in front of the girl‚Äôs face.\- Loves to brag about everything from her grades to her baking skills to how much she gyms. She tends to talk about how she‚Äôs a really nice, kind person. For example, she once took a survey for a stranger because she said she knows how it feels to not have people take a survey. \- She can be quite arrogant about her abilities, often bragging about how smart she is whenever she gets a good grade on an exam. Sometimes this arrogance leads to putting others down, like she once repeatedly told everyone around her, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do math‚Äù when she was solving math problems. However whenever she does poorly, she constantly talks about how she‚Äôs so stupid and how she‚Äôs sad. I assume it‚Äôs to get reassurance, but I‚Äôm not sure.\- Always thinks she‚Äôs right. We‚Äôve done group work problems together and I showed her an answer was wrong with evidence from online sources. However she refused to believe them and still stuck to her own answer, claiming that those online sources are incorrect.\- Aggressive personality and goes after what she wants. She typically doesn‚Äôt take my food when I offer her some. However I brought in expensive chocolate for our class table to share, and she ended up putting them under her desk then asked if she could have them all even though the others in our table only had one piece. After doing this, she justified herself saying her family never takes free things though.\- We had a class in the late afternoon and she left an hour early every class session to go to the gym since she refused to get home any later than her usual time. The professor passive-aggressively called her out on leaving class, but she disobeyed him and continued doing it, saying he can‚Äôt control her.\- She openly admitted to being rude, but says it‚Äôs a good thing because people of her culture are extremely blunt. \- Often struggles making up her mind about a decision because she keeps second guessing. Always asks detailed questions for a long time and says things like, ‚ÄúAre you gonna be able to help me out? I can‚Äôt fail.‚Äù\- Can get controlling in group work if no one‚Äôs doing anything, especially since she hates free riders. Once in a class, she yelled at a group member and demanded him to do work since he wasn‚Äôt doing anything. She said she can yell at them because she‚Äôs close to them (in her perspective).\- She‚Äôs extremely playful, enjoys teasing/roasting people at their expense, engages in a lot of banter, is always laughing. However she can take her jokes too far and is unaware when people get annoyed at her jokes. \- She‚Äôs pretty impatient and cares a lot about time. The first thing she prioritizes with choosing class schedules is the time. She also rushes to get home. However with classes, she also tries to avoid professors who are mean.\- Considers herself close to someone she meets only after a short period of time. She‚Äôll only have spoken to someone in class for a few weeks then say she‚Äôs close to them. \- She speaks to strangers as if she‚Äôs already friends with them. The first thing she ever said to me when we didn‚Äôt know each other yet was that she isn‚Äôt forgiving me for not choosing the college she wanted to go to, but couldn‚Äôt get into. She once also spoke to a stranger, asking them about her favorite boy band and fangirling about them.\- She does whatever she pleases to the point of even sneaking behind a professor‚Äôs desk to take pictures of his textbook without permission.\- Doesn‚Äôt like acting cheesy or expressing things like missing her friends when they leave. However she‚Äôs quite open with her emotions, often saying that she cried herself to sleep or how she‚Äôs so anxious or stressed over this or that. \- She boldly cheats on exams, taking out notes when the professor‚Äôs close in proximity. She has also gotten caught cheating before, but lied to the teacher and got away with it then proceeded to brag.\- Friendly, outgoing, very chatty, helpful, can be pretty loud, and can be generous at times. She has helped me out with homework assignments and given me free answers. She also sometimes brings food to share or gives me snacks for free (even though she gets them free).\- Has skipped classes to drive 8 hours to another city in order to go to her favorite group‚Äôs concert. \- Cheap unless it comes to her favorite boy band, which she‚Äôll spend hundreds for. She downloads free textbooks instead of purchasing them.\- She said many people find her intimidating when they meet her, probably because she has a strong personality and already acts like she‚Äôs close to whichever stranger she‚Äôs speaking to.\- Not sure if this is manipulation, but she wanted me to help her out with her internship and said she‚Äôs asking because she wants me to learn the useful information for my own good. She also kept trying to persuade me into doing the task, mentioning how all of her friends are doing it and listing reasons why it‚Äôs beneficial for me. Basically she reminded me of those marketing people who persuade sales.\- She was desperately looking for a job over the summer last year because she said she can‚Äôt stay home all day.\- Has given me unsolicited advice about paying my own bills to not leech off of my parents, etc.\- Her school note are really organized and color coordinated, but her clothes at home are in a huge pile.\- Enjoys keeping up with celebrities, running a celebrity fan page, baking and cooking, going to the gym, and watching anime.PS: I will admit my friend probably isn't healthy, but I still like her and don't view her as a bad person",Is my friend ESFP or something else?

The method essentially promotes blocking out a fixed amount of time for a task and then moving on to your next task once the time has elapsed.This technique has been different for me because it forces you to drop your current task even if you haven‚Äôt completed it. In the long run, this increases your productivity because you can set timeboxes to complete that task in the future instead of spending tons of time on it in one sitting. There‚Äôs also plenty of assessment to understand how you can work faster with your timebox.

444,ESFP,"I have been really falling for this girl who is an ESFP. We met close to a year ago and I started crushing on her right away. I made that part very clear to her and she has told me that she has also found me to be cute and attractive. I eventually got the nerve to ask her to hang out and we have spent a lot of time together. She‚Äôs super fun to be around and her presence is really intriguing. It‚Äôs never a dull moment during our hang outs. We have had sex and we have been on dates, but she hates labels and does not want me to begin to classify us as anything other than friends, which I understand. She isn‚Äôt really ready for anything serious at the moment and I understand that too. My question though, is how do I approach her about becoming more serious when she is in a place more suitable for that? I feel like the thought of something more scares her and I don‚Äôt want to bring up something like that and tell her that I want to be with her just to have it result in me being pushed away or to have it ruin our friendship and how close we are. I like her a lot and I just worry that while I wait for her to be in a place for something serious, I‚Äôll become a back burner thought. Like one day I‚Äôll wake up and think she still isn‚Äôt ready for anything and then she‚Äôll end up with someone else. I know that I overthink things as an INFP and maybe some of this is illogical thinking, but this has just been weighing on me and I just wanted some insight from other ESFP‚Äôs.

We met at work and have always been good friends and physically affectionate, and then around a month ago we started sleeping together when I initiated sex with him. After than we were very wrapped up in each other, and the first time we slept together I heard him say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù under his breath. We would see each other almost every day and it was the happiest I‚Äôve been in a while. To put this into context, we‚Äôve met each other‚Äôs friends, we‚Äôve opened up emotionally to each other and clicked on many levels. Bearing in mind as well that we‚Äôve been good friends for a year up until now. However, I‚Äôm worried because that now we‚Äôre back at work he has been pulling away from me and not wanting to see me one-on-one. He doesn‚Äôt want to come over anymore, not even for sex, and when I asked he fobbed me off with the vague promise of a drink sometime. I believe he‚Äôs scared that I now want an exclusive relationship, which I would definitely like if he was up for it, but I‚Äôd also be happy just hanging out like we did before. Can anyone give me an insight into what he might be thinking, and how best to proceed? I don‚Äôt want to lose the potential of what we could have, but also I‚Äôm worried that I might be scaring him off completely and I wouldn‚Äôt have him in my life at all.

455,ESFP,"So I (istp m) recently met this girl on a dating app, typically fun to be around, super social, aesthetically pleasing. I love her personality, she's funny and We had an instant connection. I'm an Istp but Also a charmer, if I like a girl, I know exactly what to say and how to say it, compliments and making her feel at ease, listen to her etc...So we hooked up on the second date but two weeks before we first met , a few days before she was hooking up with this other guy, she says she doesn't have feelings and that the sex had no emotions and she only recently found out he had a girlfriend etc but She kept going back.. And the thing is, she also told me she's not the type to have sex around with different dudes but still she admits she's been going on dates( let's say alot) just to get food, yes she did say that, just to get food, which makes me think she has a tendency of taking advantage of guys that like her. She's been partying and admit that she does have alot of guys hitting her up which isn't really a surprise to me, she's hooked up with with several guys the last few months but She also says she's never cheated before and the other day we went out and she posted me on her private snap, some guy she was talking to, texted her, cursing etc.. she told me she hooked up with him a year ago, once, then she turns around and says twice and a year ago she had a boyfriend so I was confused and pointed it out, she said she meant to say, last year, not year ago, that he was the first person she got with after her boyfriend but that it has been on and off. I let it slide but overall, I've had experiences with ESFPs in the past, it was great and I also know they don't have the best morals when it comes to dating and I know from experience, ESFPs tend to hide their different faces if they really like someone and don't want to be judged. I've been pretty non judgmental, we talk and I've been hooking up with different girls in the past and I'm also too non chalant to be judging others. I typically accept the good and bad side of people as long as the connection is genuine. There's also the fact that she needs her papers and her parents from abroad have been pressuring her and she has to get married in order to have them. We talked about it and I'd be willing to help her out in the future but she really wants to commit and  talks about marriage and having a husband which really isn't an ESFP trait as you guys mostly take relationships on a day to day basis, going with the flow. I just need an ESFP's intake on this situation. She seems like she genuinely likes me and we definitely have a connection, on the other hand I know she's looking for something. I'm just confused. Maybe she's hiding her true colors in fear of being judged or until she gets what she's looking for. Overral, I just texted her this:  And btw, I gotta tell you this. just be yourself. We talked about commitment and all of that other bullshit.. I'm really focused on myself and Yh I'm a free spirit too just like you are. Let's not rush commitment if it doesn't come naturally and is something you actually wanna do .. just don't limit yourself. You gotta want it bad enough to do so, or like us bad enough to stay with just me. So don't force yourself to commit to one person and let's build off what we have. I'm not gonna cheat, you're all I need . I'm gonna be chilling. Focused on growth while also having fun with only you. I'm definitely hooked , I have feelings for you but I'm not gonna expect much from you but honesty. Communicate and be your fun self. I'll be here for you. I'm yours if that's what you really want. Just go with the flow and if staying in one relationship is what you really want, it'll come naturally.So Fellow ESFPs, what do you think? Do you see yourself in this situation, what's your intake?","New ESFP girlfriend and I like her, I'm just not sure.."

I dislike that I was born with low energy  and bad health because it affects my ability to make more money. However, I wasn‚Äôt smart with money when I was younger (in my teen and young adult years) because I didn‚Äôt care about anything at all and I was extremely simple.

Because I‚Äôm paranoid of COVID, I get a sense of security from shopping for high quality masks, hand sanitizers, and staying at home. Also, when I shop for items, I have to triple check every detail to make sure it‚Äôs the right thing and that nothing is a scam.**What do you spend the most time thinking about?**I spend most of my time thinking about money and health.

I also always tune in weekly for this talk show that teaches people about investments, savings, and other tips when it comes to finances. I also spend a lot of time worrying about my children‚Äôs future. Aside from that, I like to find new recipes for different food I can try cooking, but I don‚Äôt listen to the directions at all. I will simply get a brief idea of how to cook it then do everything on my own without instructions. I find following recipes exactly how they should be annoying and tedious, so I usually just do taste tests.**How do you respond to clingy people?**My husband is pretty clingy and dependent on me, which can get annoying sometimes because I want everyone to be independent.

490,ESFP,"Some of my friends and I have trouble deciding if our friend is ESFJ or ESTJ, so I posted on those subreddits. However, someone suggested she may be an ESFP.\- People are often intimidated by her upon first meeting because she has a super strong personality. She likes to roast people and banter with them even if she's only known them for a day. She also appears extremely outgoing from the get-go, speaking to strangers as if she's already known them for a long time. I was intimidated by her because when we met from a group project, she was a bit rude, controlling, temperamental, and confrontational while leading us. However, I got to know her better after that and she redeemed herself because she has a very playful personality and doesn't have bad intentions when she acts mean. \- Her self-esteem fluctuates from very confident to sometimes being insecure, but she typically has high self-confidence. She likes bragging about her accomplishments, but when there are setbacks, she speaks about herself negatively (ex: calling herself dumb). She also speaks negatively as a way to get pity and possibly reassurance since she repeatedly insults herself.\- When it comes to school, she needs a lot of guidance. She always asks for my advice on which classes to register for and overthinks every choice. She fears taking classes alone because she thinks she might fail without friends. She takes super long to finalize a decision since she's always hesitating between choices and asking thousands of questions.\- She's good at understanding where others are coming from. One time, a stranger asked us to take a survery and I declined sicne I was lazy, but she helped and said it's because she knows how it feels from personal experience when people rejected her while she had a similar task.\- She can be pretty helpful and usually isn't the type of person to be greedy. I've offered her food and other things, but she typically doesn't take anything unless I insist. She gives me free food from her home sometimes and has let me copy her work. One of her biggest pet peeves is free-riders who take everything yet never give back. Although she's pretty nice, she can also exaggerate how good of a person she is. A lot of times she likes to tell stories about how kind-hearted she is.\- We've ditched class in the middle of a lab and our professor passive-aggressively called us out for it. She continued ditching and ignored what he said because she claimed he can't control us. \- Her hobbies include keeping up with male celebrities, running a fanpage of them, going to the gym, baking, and cooking. She skipped class to drive to a city 8 hours away for a concert.\- She's uncomfortable with cheesy things like giving goodbye speeches, but she's not really uncomfortable about speaking about her emotions. She's told me about crying herself to sleep, being stressed / anxious, and how she's emotional on her period.\- She has called herself a rude person but she doesn't see this as a bad thing since her family is like that. She's also somewhat aggressive with getting what she wants. One time I brought a variety of food for a few friends to share, but she snatched the whole thing asking if she could take it all even though the others barely had any.\- She exaggerates how hardworking she is, claiming that she doesn't know why she failed an exam when she studied nonstop for a week. At the same time, once she does well on an exam, she then claims she barely tried.\- She's quite concerned with saving time and is a fast-paced person. We both hate waiting for buses and often sprint to make the soonest one coming even if it'll be crowded. \- She feels close to people very quickly. As long as she speaks to someone a few times, she'll claim they're a friend and if she knows them on a level that's closer than a classmate, she'll say she's close to them.",Is my friend an ESFP

494,ESFP,"Hey everyone.My name is Oliver Powell. I'm a psychologist and my personality type is is ESTP 8w7 sx/sp.I wanted to give all of you a warning, as I ran a check on the YouTuber CS Joseph and I found out that he's full of bullshits. He is a con artist and he is horrible at typology.1. MBTI is about cognitive preferences. It doesn't automatically equal skills. Chase doesn't keep that in mind, so he ends up using a lot of bullshit stereotypes. No wonder that he mistypes a lot of people.2. Any combo of enneagram and MBTI is possible. Enneagram covers basic motivations... But he disregards the enneagram, fusing automatically basic motivations within cognitive functions, ending up easily mistyping people. For instance he insists in claiming that Frank James is an INFP, when Frank James is an INFJ with enneagram 4w5.3. Some of the concepts that he talks about are in a nutshell a bastardized version of socionics model A, but repackaged with different terminology. For instance his ""four sides of the mind"" are called in socionics model A as ego block, id block (unconscious ego), super id block (subconscious ego) and superego block.4. He isn‚Äôt an ENTP as he claims. Chase is an unhealthy ESTJ (ego Te Si Ne Fi) 6w5 SO 613 often stuck in Te-Ne loops and on top of that he has most likely ASPD.First of all Chase is a Te Dom:4D valued Leading/Dominant Te: ""*Extroverted logic as base function is manifested as a need to accumulate factual information, also from external sources such as books, second-hand information, etc, on matters of personal interest or of professional activity. This also gives these types confidence on being well-informed on the same matters, which enables them to enter arguments related to them with confidence on their knowledge, which may come across as arrogance to others. Another manifestation is an evaluation of external reality - work activities, world events, finances, procedures, personal relationships, conversations - from the point of view of factual accuracy and ""making sense"" and efficiency. It leads to an inclination to be proactive in increasing the efficiency and reasonableness of the external world, as well as a sense of self-worth connected on being involved and productive in activities seen as useful, profitable, or that increase one's knowledge base. To give out information that the individual knows not to be factually accurate is disturbing and avoided as much as possible.""*His second slot Si is poorly developed and he often turns it off, enganging often in Te-Ne loops:*""ESTJs can also develop a warped or imbalanced use of their auxiliary function, Introverted Sensing (Si). When this happens,* ***they become obsessed with sticking to what they know, rapidly closing off alternate viewpoints and perspectives. They may become deeply upset by change¬† or they may become focused on seeing impracticalities in others. They may become so tied to their own personal, subjective experience that they discount other people‚Äôs experiences or are unwilling to see other perspectives.*** *Healthy Si is very aware of details, facts, sense-impressions, and important memories. It is practical, responsible, and highly attuned to changing patterns. Unhealthy Si feels that everything needs to fall in adherence with one‚Äôs own subjective experience of how things have always been.""*\^ Hence the over-generalization that Chase makes all over in his videos.Look at this description and you'll realize that his Ne is actually third slot, not first slot as he claims:2D valued Mobilizing/Child: ""***The individual deeply appreciates people who are full of ideas and imagination and who give them a sense of connectedness to what is happening ""out there in the world,"" even if this information cannot be applied practically at the present momen****t. He is even more grateful for people who provide insightful ideas and unconventional analysis to enhance what he is working on or going through at the present moment.""*You can see Chase often complimenting and appreciating people who are full of ideas, for example nominating in several occasion his mentor and talking about him.Chase is often looping between Te and Ne:*""When an ESTJ is in a Te-Ne loop, they are unable to effectively access their introverted functions, Si and Fi. During these times, they become obsessed with possibilities, but often in a negative light. They may see a million ways things could go wrong and try to ‚Äújump in‚Äù and fix them as quickly as possible without looking at the facts or taking the time to carefully observe the situation internally. They may have a difficult time prioritizing or reaching their goals and they may take hasty action on strange, intuitive whims without really understanding where their premonitions are coming from. This can be a very stressful stage for them as they feel more and more frustrated by their inability to organize, plan, and decide as effectively as they usually do. It‚Äôs important for ESTJs who realize they‚Äôre in a Te-Ne loop to get healthy access to Si. Take some time to enjoy some peace and quiet and reflect on an experience you enjoy. Find a favorite activity that you‚Äôve always enjoyed, whether it‚Äôs a crossword puzzle or cooking a certain meal, and repeat that process. Give yourself time to ‚Äúintrovert‚Äù and do some no-pressure detail-oriented project. Getting Si back into the picture will help you regain composure and get out of a loop.""*As further proof of him being an ESTJ:*- He finds Ni irritating (Ni being Vulnerable/Trickster for ESTJs), despising INFJs (the conflictuals of ESTJs) and having problems with INTJs (different methods to get effective results done).**- He praises a lot Ti, which in ESTJ is their Observing function, and in particular ISTPs. And the default communication style of ISTP is the best way to communicate with ESTJs.**- Love/hate relationship with high Fi users, but in particular xNFP types. It points to Fi Suggestive/Inferior.**- He is a more chaotic than usual for ESTJs due to being in Te-Ne loops.*Some people think that Chase's main enneagram is 3w4, but what they're sensing is the disintegration phase of Chase.Chase is an unhealthy 6w5.*""Unhealthy 6w5 become increasingly paranoid and obsessed with maintaining their security, and may go to great lengths to protect their positions. They are extremely needy, and may abuse alcohol or drugs as a way of dealing with anxiety and paranoid delusions, as well as of bolstering their inferioirty feelings. The Five-wing adds elements of cynicism and nihilism to the fearful mentality of the unhealthy Six, resulting in growing isolation, desperation, and a capacity for sociopathic actions. Intense stress will likely lead to outbreaks of rage and extremely destructive behavior accompanied by breaks with reality. Self-sabotaging, self-destructive actions bring about humiliation and punishment to atone for guilt, although the extent and nature of their self-destructiveness will be hidden from others because of their reclusive nature. There may be strong propensity for violence as well as sadomasochistic tendencies in sexual expression. Murder and suicide are both real possibilities.""*Primary instinct SO (social). Tritype 613, considering that one of his ex mentioned how much Chase tends to avoid conflicts (*main instinct core 1*) and his self esteem is based on achievements (*3 as main heart core*).Unhealthy 613s disintegrate towards 349... 6 disintegrates to 3: competive and arrogant; 1 disintegrates to 4: moody and irrational \[*like claiming that the sperm becomes the brain, spine and nervous system... Look at the video analysis""What MBTI personality is sperm"" by FlowState lol*\]; 3 disintegrates to 9: \[disengaged and apathetic.So the question is... Why he lies about his type?The whole ENTP charade is how he justifies his unhealthy behaviours and avoids therapy.Amongst his unhealthy behaviours, I‚Äôll mention that‚Ä¶* Chase committed identity theft.* One of his exes went to a therapist after frequenting him due to how much emotional damage he caused to her during their relationship.* As mentioned by his ex Ande Sloeijk, Chase displayed behaviours that they‚Äôre congruent with someone with NPD (*amorous subtype*) or similar in their courtship.* He persuaded a couple to avoid seeking help for their autistic son. Flowstate made a video analysis on the topic on Youtube. (**CS Joseph's Dangerous Advice | ""Ignore Your Son's Doctors"" | Criticism)*** Pathological lying.* A lot of passive-aggressiveness.* Misleading information about his figure income to trick people into giving him more money. Flowstate made an approximate audit about Chase‚Äôs business (‚Äú**Cooking the Books: C.S.

495,ESFP,,How each MBTI type dances
496,ESFP,"So I figured I'd talk about one of the most obvious ESFPs ever with Super Mario himself here from the Super Mario Bros game series. Mario is ESFP and is one of the best ones of all time as we all know and the biggest video game character in the world made by a ENFP video game creator being Shigeru Miyamoto himself, an Ne dom in Nintendo and core foundation on why Nintendo succeeded in the 90s with his Ne idea on making the Arcade game Donkey Kong way back then that blew up and changed the world as we know. Which all led to Mario Bros and the Super Mario Bros. series and games we know and love today. Miyamoto an ENFP made Mario an ESFP and Link an ISFP, so there you have it, some of the greatest video game characters of all time are SPs not NFs or intuitive, let's give it up for them here, Mario is the the best and greatest ESFP game character and best ESFP character possibly ever and here's why with my opinion down below.Super Mario Bros, can't wait to talk about this one and Mario here. Mario is energetic, fun, goofy, down to earth and practical. He's very hands on and is good with a hammer and a plumber at that which all works perfectly with his hands on Se and his Se reacting to details around him and using his hammer when necessary to smash things and enemies and his classic jumping ability as well. Mario uses his Se to jump very easily in the world around him and react and respond to details fully in the moment, he pays attention to all details around him with his Se and responds and reacts to details spontaneously and impulsively with his Se dom impulsiveness and spontaneity fully in the moment and is a excellent jumper because of it and his Se skills as an ESFP. He follows his inner values and heart inside which is all Fi, and doesn't care for what society says or thinks and goes on dangerous adventures and tries to save princess peach whenever he can and when necessary. He gets the job done with his Te ter and gets goals done with the things he cares about and is sometimes efficient when he can be and never fails to hop in and try to save Peach with a moments notice with his Te efficiency being third and Se jumping in on impulse in the moment and responding to details quickly when Peach gets kidnapped and jumping at the chance and moment to save her immediately without hesitation. He loves to entertain and perform in front of people with his jumped skills and Se and Fi as an ESFP performer, when he does his triple jump in some games he puts his hands up in the air like he just performed in front of people in a stage show or play he's in with the impression he's trying to show his jumping skills off to people and entertain them and perform in front of them and impress them with his great jumping skills and abilities he has with his Se. Any type can love physical activity and be good a doing physical things and like physical things too, including Ne users, but Mario clearly is a Se dom here with loving to pay attention to respond to all details around him with his Se and living fully in the moment with it too and just caring for reacting to details today only and not focusing on the past or future very much at all.Mario is also very adaptable with his Se being in the moment, he can adapt to any weather and new details he has to respond to in the sensory environment with his Se and he reacts to all details around them and pays attention to all details around him easily while respond to them quickly and spontaneously in the moment without fail with his Se dom behavior all the time no matter what terrain or situation he's in or presented with. He's a plumber again and uses a hammer, this is the perfect hands on image of Se and Mario's character. He's a very hands on Se dom and ESFP that follows his heart and jumps and performs and reacts and responds to details fully in the moment and doesn't really care about the future too much with his inferior Ni and just goes with the flow with his Se and focuses on what's going on fully in the moment and what's going on today as well and takes life day by day with his Se in general in each game he's always in. Some of the best games Mario has been in is Super Mario RPG, and Paper Mario series along with the great classic platformer Mario games we know and love today like the masterpiece game of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario Odyssey too along with many others like Galaxy and Mario 64.Mario is the classic ESFP and one of the greatest ESFP characters of all time. ESFP is the best personality type for a platformer game series and a jumpman plumber, which is what he was named and called initially as Jumpman first haha, who uses a hammer to hit things and fight with his hands on Se that responds to all details around him in the moment, Miyamoto hit the mark and made the best ESFP game character ever clearly here with Mario and we thank him so much for the genius idea and creation he made with this amazing character and game series he created and invented for us, thank you Shigeru Miyamoto for everything. Everyone knows Mario around the world so I don't need to explain this. Feel free to share your opinion on this down below on what you think, if your curious on the other major characters, I type Bowser ESTJ, Princess Peach ESFJ, Princess Daisy ENFP, Luigi ISFJ. I can do more later on like the Paper Mario series and Super Mario RPG posts in depth at a later date. In short I type Mallow INFP btw and Geno INTJ.Here's a great Mario ESFP post here by FunkyMBTI:[https://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/158027721211/super-mario-brothers-mario-esfp](https://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/158027721211/super-mario-brothers-mario-esfp)","Mario [ESFP] - One of the Greatest ESFPs of All Time and the Best ESFP Video Game Character Ever, Super Mario Bros MBTI Types"

But I score high on function tests for FE and often see myself as having FE but Im wondering if I'm not looking at it right and its harder to look at yourself sometimes I think.I am always atuned to how other people are feeling, I worry about how comfortable they feel and don't want to upset anyone. I'll be honest with others always but try and do it in a really fluffy tactful way as to not make them feel attacked. The whole morals/principles part of Fi isn't something I can pin down....what are your morals/principles...what does this mean for you?I DONT think everything is either good or bad and Ive often been accused of sitting on the fence, purely because I can sympathise with both sides a lot of the time and would rather respect each others differences.I guess the only time I really see Fi in myself is as a mother. I am so empathatic to the feelings of children and do not like harsh punishment, leaving to cry etc (not looking to debate this as its not the point). But yeah, when it comes to kids I can get very Fi, this is what i believe in and i feel strongly that x, y and z are wrong. I'll then try and evidence my feelings on these matters to try and put out a message to others. anyway if you got this far into my rambling let me know what you think...what is Fi for you? what are some good ways to differentiate between the two?

509,ESFP,"(Sorry if this is long, being concise is not a strong suit) So I‚Äôve consistently never tested as anything other than ESFP-A over the last decade or so. I feel like I‚Äôm experiencing a sort of ‚Äúimposter syndrome‚Äù with being an ESFP though, mostly because of how practical and methodical I am. Does anyone else see their personality manifest in these ways?: Relationships: I get along with my INTJ boyfriend VERY well. I know practicality is a hallmark of ESFPs, but I feel like I plan plan plan like no other, which isn‚Äôt very typical of this type, but really helps in my relationship. We often face a disconnect on empathy (I‚Äôm a huge empath) but we mesh really well when it comes to being ‚Äúobsessive‚Äù about weird/nerdy things, and when getting things done together. I also tend to be very loyal in relationships, though I jump very quickly into a new one when they end (I ‚Äúbounce back quickly‚Äù).Events/life goals: I‚Äôm a chatterbox, willing to speak my mind on anything, and very comfortable improvising. However I often spend hours researching, preparing, and organizing for any event, trip, or life goal - is this typical of ESFPs?! Sometimes my planning is mobilized as socially-driven (I‚Äôll plan impeccable events, holidays, vacations for people) or experience-driven (I want to order the *best* thing from a new restaurant), but often I feel like I have a non-stop almost domineering desire to plan out my life and next steps. If I want something, (a relationship, a friendship, a job) I‚Äôm impatient, so I immediately jump into gear to get on a path for that ‚Äúthing‚Äù. Does anyone else relate to this? School/career: I was a precocious child and have always been exceptionally good at school and work. Despite a low-income background, I managed to get multiple degrees from prestigious schools, and I do analytical research for a living, where I leverage my charismatic energy to ‚Äúsell‚Äù my analyses and conclusions. Yet I never seem to see other ESFPs in these roles, and people are always surprised when I say I‚Äôm ESFP (I‚Äôve literally never met another ESFP in school or work).TLDR; I‚Äôm overly practical, forward-looking, booksmart, ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù, analytical, and constantly planning things. I ALWAYS test as an ESFP, and I feel like one socially, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm not ‚Äútypical‚Äù for this type.

I am fairly good at mood swings, I totally have my own mood swings, so I am able to brush it off when the kids have them. I can have a bit of a fiery temper when a trigger happens but I am very quick to apologize or I am able to excuse myself and have my temper tantrum on my own. Also, it‚Äôs been interesting having such introverted and cautious kids while my husband (ENTP) and I are sooooo extroverted and I am a wild woman haha. I‚Äôve had to learn their language and realize when I can‚Äôt push them and when they need to recharge but it‚Äôs been a massive learning curve for me.

There‚Äôs even been research that has shown a 7% decline in productivity across the US since the pandemic started. It can even be tricky to enter a state of flow.Even though, there seems to be a lot more time to do things like bake bread, redecorate your home, etc. There are times when you don‚Äôt feel like doing anything either, but this often tends to be couple with guilt that you aren‚Äôt doing enough during this time. However, it‚Äôs even more important to realize that it‚Äôs perfectly fine to not want to do anything at all because these are, in fact, uncertain times!What‚Äôs worked for me is to revisit my goals and focus my energy towards my passions and the things that matter most, instead of trying to just get things done.

And was mad at world/people for some time because i just couldnt be what i am, and kinda forced to change myself to be noticed/do stuff/get things, but it got over it. I think. And in competitive world that we live in phrases like ""Make something out of yourself"" just make me pissed and im like ""stfu"" lol. Usually Fi is described as inner morals (?)

521,ESFP,"Gon FreecssGon MBTI - Gon Freecss is ENFPGon Freecss MBTI is ENFP - Hunter x Hunter MBTIThe thought the ESFP reddit would be interested and intrigued with my Gon Freecss ENFP argument here. I repost this old post I made to a few places and forums already and thought you guys would like this too. I‚Äôm very interested in your opinions and would like people to objectively  share their opinions down below without personal feelings coming into play with your liking of the character of other reasons that might cloud accurate judgement. Tell me what you think objectively and personally on the ENFP vs ESFP debate here, I would like to see if you guys agree with my ENFP points here for Gon and my arguement why I type him so since I think he gets confused a lot with you guys which is understandable.I posted this Gon Freecss ENFP post and argument I made a long time ago on the MBTI reddit and I'm really proud of it and love this post as a result through the years, I feel I fixed a lot of misconceptions people have with Gon's type and character with this and showed here how he uses Ne all the time, uses Si way more often than Se but still struggles with Si too to be an Si inferior user and acts very NF and is extremely idealistic as a character and NF as well in Hunter x Hunter. So I thought like I did a long time ago with my Goku ENFP repost from reddit that I did a long time ago, that I would post this one as well. Thanks for the support and feel free to share your opinions down below.Here's a Myers-Briggs post of why Gon is ENFP with just developed sensing, particularly developed Si and is actually an Ne user and uses Ne all the time and is a Ne dom for sure as an ENFP and Si user to over Se which Gon doesn't use much of at all in the series actually. Hope you enjoy this Hunter x Hunter MBTI - Myers-Briggs typing post, share your thoughts and opinions on my Gon Freecss MBTI analysis down below.So I decided I'm rewatching Hunter x Hunter again recently, and I haven't watched it in awhile but I know Gon's character and know he's ENFP and an Ne user with developed introverted sensing to help him survive in the Hunter world he's in. I'm going to write posts down below on why Gon Freecss is ENFP with just developed sensing but still Ne the whole series. I'm only on episode 2 on my rewatch right now, so I'm only gonna bring up a few points but even after 2 episodes I have perfect examples of his Ne and him being ENFP in the show, its already that obvious already so I'm gonna explain that down below. I'm going to update this post overtime as I watch the series so look forward to more content on why Gon is ENFP and uses Ne in the future, thanks.Gon starts off the series heading off to be a hunter after catching the lord of the sea and his stepmom Mito tries to convince him not to be a hunter because the world is dangerous and his father left him for the hunter life instead of raising him. Gon proceeds to tell Mito isn't that amazing for him to do that and leave his son to be a hunter, it must be that amazing. Gon displays here that he's the type to at times ignore realistic facts thrown at him and instead be idealistic and give people chances and the benefit of the doubt to consider the possibilities of why Ging left in the first place, he completely ignores Ging's hurtful actions and gives him a chance anyway, these are traits of ENFPs giving everyone a chance and Ne considering possibilities with people giving them the benefit of the doubt before judging them. Then he proceeds to say I don't know what the world is like and says he wants to know more about the world and why Ging left and where he is, he showcases Ne curiosity in this scene and wants to see the world and discover why Ging left and his location in the world, this is pure curiosity about the future and what's out there.Gon then uses Ne and Si on the ship to predict the storm. I'm going to be comparing this storm scene from the manga and anime and revising this part of my post since I did more research in the coming months up till now and have an even better understanding of the functions up to this point. So in the manga in chapter 2 Gon actually predicted the 2nd storm because there was two storms coming and that came in the manga where as the anime only showed one storm and had him predict that one. This obviously highlights his Ne because he's making a prediction and sees a possibility that will happen and believes in it, and further evidence of why he believes in his hunch of a big storm is coming in terms of the manga is he says the wind is tepid and salty and that the sea cranes are yelling out warnings, which showcases Gon's Si. Gon we can clearly interpret in this scene has been through this experience before with a big storm coming and these signs coming up, he remembers these conditions being met in his memory and their happening again which makes him able to make a confident prediction of a huge storm is coming and even predict the size of the storm and time frame it will hit when the captain asks him.This is all clearly signs of Si and Ne in Gon with remembering past experiences and seeing the conditions and circumstances of those past experiences arising again to be able to make a confident prediction that something will happen soon and is coming, Si and Ne coming out in Gon clearly in this scene. I'm glad I was able to fix this point in this post and understand it properly after more research on the functions because this scene always confused me I'll admit but I go it down now. And in terms of the anime, the scene in general plays out the same except without going into more detail about the salty wind and it being tepid and the part of predicting the time and size, and of course Gon only predicts the first and the only one storm that happened in the anime. But my points still stand in the anime version and manga version despite the differences in how they played out. This is one of many moments you see Gon's good introverted sensing skills that help him as a hunter but he does have Se moments as well that I'll mention if you read on even if not as much, and of course there is plenty of Ne moments in Gon that I'll mention if you keep reading forward.A perfect example of Gon using Si again that might go unnoticed for some people is also on the ship right after Kurapika and Leorio finish fighting. Gon stops the captain from yelling at them and telling them to comeback because Mito his aunt once told him, I'll again use the manga because the anime made some weird changes it worded it a little different, but the point still stands in the manga Gon tells us she said in the past to him: ""If you want to know a person, find out what makes him angry."" Gon states this is one of Aunt Mito's favorite sayings and then says they're both mad about something, we should leave them to work it out. This shows Gon is the kind of person more than most people to really treasure the past in terms of things that are meaningful and that he takes certain values and things he was taught in the past very seriously even now at his current age and time on the ship and that he doesn't forget these important values from the past. Gon showcasing he's the type of person to remember and treasure important values he was taught in the past further showcases his developed inferior Si as an ENFP, which is also similar to Luffy and Shanks with Luffy's actions in the bar scene in Jaya as an interesting parallel I noticed in Gon and Luffy here just to bring that up to compare. Luffy from One Piece is an obvious ENFP as well in my opinion and is very similar to Gon and has this similar parallel of treasuring values from the past and following till the end in current day in their lives. I could bring up more obvious parallels from other characters like Goku naming Gohan after Grandpa Gohan and putting the 4 star Dragon Ball on his hat, Luffy obsessing over no one ever damaging his Straw Hat and so on, but I think you get the point I'm getting at here by now reading this far so I'll move onto the next point. Again Gon's motivation to see Ging is Ne, he wants to find him to find more information about why he left him to be a hunter, the common desire in Ne users for exploration and information gathering based on curiosity caused by their Ne and what the function values. This curiosity for information from his Dad about his motivation drives Gon the entire series.But a perfect scene where you see how this is Gon's (Si) at work is when he's able to tell those giant rabbit guys apart by paying attention to their details and remembering how the other looked from memory and being able to compare them based on that memory and tell them apart (Si). Gon's developed Si is very interesting in this scene since Leorio couldn't tell them apart and he's an Si user as well which goes to show how experienced Gon is in the wilderness and shows his potential as a Hunter. Keep reading because the best part I have for Gon being ENFP and using Ne is written down below, it's literally the perfect scene.Another major Si moment in Gon is when he drank the poison drink made by Tonpa and given to him and his friends during the early exams. Gon starts drinking the juice and then stops immediately after tasting it and spits it out. He says I think this drink has gotten bad Tonpa, it tastes strange. He then tells Tonpa that he sampled and tasted plants and grasses back on his island and home in the past and because of that he knows and can tell when something tastes off and goes bad. This is perfect Si moment for Gon because he compared the taste of the drink to past experiences of tasting plants from his home town and island from him trying different plants back in the past when he was younger growing up on his island. He compared and contrasted those experiences and the tastes of those plants he once ate and consumed to the taste of the drink he drank right in that moment. And also he was aware of his body state at the touch of tasting the drink and his body told him this drink is bad and unsafe because of again the plants he tried and sampled on his island. So this whole poison drink scene was a major Si moment in Gon with him recognizing the poison based him tasting plants before on his island, so I just wanted to explain that here in depth since its such a major scene of Si for him.Now this next scene is shows major amount of proof Gon is ENFP and an Ne user, I'm surprised people missed this since this is such prime example of his Ne being used in the series, all the way back in episode two. If you haven't guessed its the two question quiz scene, now let me explain why Gon uses Ne here and this is the perfect scene for showing he's ENFP. Leorio proceeds to get mad because the right answer is subjective and that picking either choose is immoral because you should love each person the lady makes you have to choose from, this is a question you should struggle with if your a decent good person, which we see is the case with the three characters here. Kurapika explains to Leorio after they're done silence was the right answer, you weren't supposed to choose since it'd be immoral to quickly pick between the two and would be a struggle.Now after the quiz is over and everyone is ready to move forward, Gon is still thinking about the answer to the question and the possible scenarios! He takes a breath and sits there confused because he can't find the right answer, Leorio tells him they found the right answer and the quiz is over and you can stop now Gon, let's go now and move forward! Gon says I know the quiz is over but why should I stop thinking about the answer? He then proceeds to explain what if I run into that situation in the future and I can only save one person? He asks what should I do? It wouldn't right to pick only one of them but one day I might have to make that hard choice if the situation arises in the future suddenly one day. Extroverted intuition is about ""What If and What could be"" and all the possible scenarios in a situation, Extroverted Sensing is about ""What is and the here and now"" and how to handle a current situation presented to me completely now in the moment. An Se user in this scene would have struggled with the question like the rest did but once they heard the right answer would have been relieved and said good we found the right answer so now let's move forward. Gon literally continues to think about the possible scenarios and tries think of all the possibilities in this situation and find in an answer because he knows it's possible this scenario might possibly happen in the future and he should be prepared for it and think of all the possible options to handle it if it comes up. The old lady literally states that is the purpose of this test, you must be ready to face all the worst possible scenarios that may come your way in life because they may come out of nowhere without you expecting it in the future and that's literally what Gon does in this scene, considers all the possible options of the future in this scenario (Ne). This is a complete perfect example of Ne and extroverted Intuition in Gon and showcases why Gon is an ENFP. I rest my case, now on to the next part.I'll keep adding more examples as the show progress on my rewatch, but yeah I just wanted to clear up why Gon is not ESFP and why he is actually ENFP with just developed introverted sensing to help him survive in the crazy world he's been born into and to maintain his occupation and survive in the future as he grows Hunter, this is a series where you need sensing to survive, even for the most intuitive characters like Gon and Killua, an ENFP and INTP, and his Se is also strong as well but his Si is much stronger and shows up way more often in the story and series.___I have more to add now since I've gotten further on my rewatch. Episode 12 is a perfect example of Gon's Ne as well. When they got to the crossroads on picking the long and easy short path, they didn't have enough and were forced to fight to figure out who were gonna be the two people left behind and which three we're gonna move forward. Gon paid attention to the weapons and them hitting the walls and this sparked an idea to use them to help their situation. Gon's Ne saw the possibilities in the moment and gave him the idea to use the weapons to break down the wall in the long path to make a shortcut to the short, his Ne generated that possibility in his mind on the spot and gave them the answer to pass everyone and not leave anyone behind. That's literally what Ne is, thinking about all the possibilities in a situation and assessing all the options possible in the future, Gon does this perfectly in this scene and episode as well along with my other examples mentioned before. This a second prime example of Gon's Ne, further proving why he's ENFP and how he uses Ne in the series.Some more Ne moments of Gon is he comes up with Jajaken and he comes up with the idea to trick the Chimera Ant with the multiple arms by calling out a different Rock, Paper, Scissors attack than the one he actually used, just like kid Goku did to Jackie Chun back in Dragon Ball.I've gotten even further and have more to say and have evidence to oppose Gon's use of Se, and have proof that he doesn't use it in the series from a weakness I found, further showcasing how he uses Ne more.When Gon steals the badge from Hisoka, when he runs off he gets attacked by the black hunter guy with glasses. After he snipes him and knocks Gon over he proceeds to tell Gon he could have killed him thousands of times because he wasn't paying attention. He tells Gon he doesn't pay attention to his surroundings which is why he was able to snipe him and attack him like that and take his badge. This showcases Gon doesn't have Se dominant and his sensing isn't as strong as it seems even if in the series its decently developed, further showcasing Gon uses Ne much more instead and isn't very good at paying attention to his surroundings.Gon asks a lot of Ne curiosity questions all the time too since Ne users ask a lot of questions a lot in their life because of Ne curiosity seeing possibilities and wondering and imagining about everything they see in the world and with the people they meet. Killua even mentions this trait in Gon is useful when he says ""It's good to have some around who's not afraid of always questions."" Killua says this trait is good and useful in Gon when they try to runaway from Phinks and the Phantom Troupe guys right after the YorkNew City Arc ends and there at the auction and accidentally see them again right after being let go by them in the exchange for getting Chrollo back from them for Gon and Killua as a trade between two hostages during the arc.Gon used Ne and Si when he was training to predict where birds will be in the future with their movements to catch them. He focused and remembered their movement patterns with his Si and was trying to predict in the future of where they'll end up being based on remembering and memorizing their moving habits. This is the Ne and Si axis. Gon also sees a bird catching a fish and pays attention to it. He sees the bird catch the fish and remembers it and thinks about it and then when he sees another bird catch a fish he comes up with the idea on how to catch the bird, with it being going for the target the second if goes for its prey, another Ne Si moment in Gon once again. And the entire time he wasn't paying to attention to his surroundings that the black hunter comments about when he's shown hiding behind the bushes showing his low Se and rather Gon living in his own world with his Ne fully out of touch with reality while he focused on practicing to predict where the birds will be. Gon also came up with the idea with his Ne on to use the butterfly's to track Hisoka after remembering with his Si the detail of Hisoka being injured earlier in the past.Some more content as I continue to watch more of the series:Back in the cave with the snakes Gon believes in his hunch that the antidote is definitely there in the dead guy's clothes even if there is not much evidence it is there. He sees the possibility the antidote is there for sure even if there's a chance its not there at all.The appraiser guy assess Gon and his character, he says in his head Gon is a boy who approaches things with pure curiosity, he doesn't judge things or people too fast as good or bad he says. He highlights pure curiosity is Gon's unique attribute, that's a clear sign of Ne and Extroverted Intuition as well in Gon.Another Ne moment in Gon is when he says he had a hunch on how the selection for the players for Greed Island worked when they were waiting in the stands to start and get picked for the Greed Island game and participate. Killua was over analyzing the situation and the guy behind him told him how it worked and said how Gon predicted this ahead of time. Gon says yes to this and confirms he was trusting his hunch of how the selection for Greed Island was going and he trusted his hunch and focused on controlling his Nen to get ready for his turn the whole, this a major Ne moment in Gon and shows him relying on his hunches and intuition yet again for his decision making for a problem and situation that came up for them to handle and try to figure out so that they can keep moving forward with their goals as usual.So I have some examples now for inferior Si. The biggest example of this is like one of the examples I mentioned above of Gon noticing and telling the big rabbits guy's apart from observing them and remembering what one looked like and comparing one from memory to another, this is (Si) in a nutshell. Gon's Si is a strength and weakness since its very developed but still the last function he uses in the inferior function slot. Gon is not good with details and not good with remembering detailed information. I'm on the Greed Island arc and you see this trait of him when Gon gets confused with all the information of the dodgeball game coming at him, he gets confused and flustered easily with too many details and information. I remember this happening plenty of other times when Gon spaced out, was confused, and puzzled when heavy information was being throw at him throughout the series and his brain gets fried and smoke comes out of his ears. This happens also with the Knuckle explanation, along with the other moments in the series.The Genthru scene is also a huge Ne moment, since Gon mentions how he has to be selfish in this situation in his mind to Bisky and proceeds to go after a chance he sees to injure Genthru. Gon sees a possibility to attack Genthru and cause major damage to him but its a huge risk, Gon doesn't care and focuses on the idea because he sees the possibility to carry out this idea and he wants to do whatever he can to make this possibility come to fruition, even if there's a chance he'll lose both his arms and life in the process.My last points will be a few Ne moments that happened that I'll summarize from the Chimera Ant arc and idealism Gon showed in the arc as well. Gon shows Ne a few times this arc and I'll just mentioned two moments here. When the falling arrows come down onto the castle and then they charge in, they start running towards the stairs in that famous scene and Youpi sees them. They didn't expect the arrows to come down and just had to go with the flow and keep running and stick to the plan everyone thought in their mind but Gon has a Ne moment that nobody else sees here. He thought of the possibility ahead of time of what if Knuckle and the Chameleon guy got hit and we're dead on the ground still invisible? They didn't know the limit of his invisible powers so its was still possible, and if that possibility existed and happened then who was gonna fight Youpi if this series of possibilities happened? Gon realized all of this in an instant and instantly ran towards Youpi from the start assuming this happened and knew if these what if scenarios happened that he or someone had to deal with Youpi and he chose to go for it despite the risk and uncertainty, this a huge Ne moment in Gon and its scene that should be recognized and understood properly since its such a huge Ne moment so I hope I helped make it clear. Now the next one is Kite, Gon the entire arc sees the possibility to save Kite with his Ne, he blames himself and gets hung up on the past with his Si and he feels he's the reason Kite was captured and lost his arm. Despite all this and him regretting being there holding him back and causing that incident he hopelessly believes no matter what that Kite can be saved. No matter how unrealistic it seems or what facts get presented to him and hints that Kite can't make it, is dead, or can't be saved, he doesn't believe it until the very end when he brings Pitou with him to see and try to fix Kite anyway. Gon is idealistic about saving Kite this entire arc and doesn't listen to anyone or realism this entire time in the arc and even explodes at Killua for being level headed and telling Gon to stop at different times. He stays focused on the goal and his massive amounts of idealism for saving Kite no matter what and ignore any pratical or logical points that goes against his idealism and hope in the entire arc. It doesn't take until they finally get there to Kite and Pitou says Kite can't be saved that Gon finally breaks down and snaps and you already know the rest of what happens from there. So yeah, that's all my points for Gon being ENFP and my Ne and Si points for him so far for this post at least.Here's also a separate opinion and post that highlights the correlation of Nen types and categories and MBTI types as well and common personality MBTI characteristics that correlate with them and the different Nen types in Hunter x Hunter. It's a really great and awesome post and I highly recommend you check it out here down below. I think the poster did a really good job with this overall even I disagree with a few character typings here and there. The character MBTI types I do agree with that they typed here are Gon Freecss ENFP, Killua Zoldyk INTP, Kurapika INTJ, and I disagree but type Leorio ESFJ like most people do but we both at least agree Fe dom, and Hisoka is ENTP in my opinion and many others as well. Some others are also I personally type Chrollo INFJ list most and Franklin ISFJ but I'll stop there since this part will go on forever. Overall 3 of the main characters I agree with and Leorio and Hisoka are close to my opinion of them as well as Fe dom EXFJs and NTPs as well, that's similar enough to match with the Nen types and MBTI typings pairing anyway so its fine really. Anyways check out the post down below, its really great and well written and really well though out too:https://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/732ypx/nen_personalities_and_the_correlation_to_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",Sharing my Why Gon Freecss is (ENFP) and how he uses Ne and Si primarily more than Se post here - Hunter x Hunter MBTI
522,ESFP,"For the past few months, I‚Äôve heard a lot of buzz surrounding the concept of dopamine detox and I thought to myself, does this thing actually work or is it just another one of Silicon Valley‚Äôs dubious trend?We live in very stimulating times.

It‚Äôs not that the normal stimuli aren‚Äôt rewarding, they‚Äôre just LESS rewarding than the artificial or supernormal stimuli.A dopamine fast is the supposed antidote for the inattentiveness that plagues us, the burnout induced by too much of too many good things.We are currently living in a technologically advanced era and as such, nothing is really believable unless backed by science and research.

It‚Äôs also been embraced by several leaders like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Oprah.The rule has been broken down into 3 buckets that learning takes place through:* Reading: Investing in a reading habit can, expectedly, help you grow each and every day* Reflection: Taking the time to assess what you‚Äôve learnt and how you can get better will set you up for success in the future* Experimentation: Experiments show you what‚Äôs working and where you need to improve.I highly recommend you try this out. I explain this further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7071k1J0O0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7071k1J0O0)Once you make learning a habit, I have a strong feeling that you‚Äôll likely be more successful and productive across different areas of your life.",Following the 5 Hour Rule showed me the key to long-term productivity and growth

I don't know much about the ESFP type and would appreciate it if you gave me some tips when it comes to dealing with them. More specifically, I found out that my sister is an ESFP, and we are basically polar opposites even though we are twins. We constantly butt heads, even more so during this quaritine. Idk what it is, but when it comes to her, I lose my mind. I am very logical in my thinking, while she listens more to her feelings. This is a serious problem because when I try to explain the smallest thing in a logical point of view she takes it as criticism. She takes most of what I say personally even when I don't mean to attack her. I have also tried to ignore her at times when she is too annoying, but she finds it funny and tries to be even more annoying even though she knows I am mad at her.  I do not understand her behavior.

530,ESFP,"Question: How do you tell the difference between an ESFP and an ESFJ?

While I'm definitely NOT popular (or ever was), I seem to be a magnet for people to pour their lonely tired souls into - I absolutely HATE having this done to me, but it keeps happening and I can't say no without hurting their feelings.

548,ESFP,"I‚Äôve had a hard time learning new things. Concepts often seem to go over my head and I rarely ever recall what I thought I learnt. Over time, I realized that it was because I never truly understood what I was learning.The Feynman technique is particularly effective at helping you master difficult concepts. Named after the Nobel Prize winning Richard Feynman, the concept focuses on explaining a difficult concept in easy to understand language as if you were explaining it to someone else (or a child). By following the Feynman technique, you might just end up learning difficult concepts quickly, spend less time studying, and remember concepts longer.The four steps are as follows:1. Write the concept down2. Explain it using simple language3. Address (look up) problematic areas or questions that remain4. Challenge yourself to simplify it furtherI have found this to be a powerful concept that helps you cut study time shortly. The push to understand and explain a concept forces you to identify areas where you have a gap in your understanding.

554,ESFP,"* I feel most myself thinking of things that I can do in the real world. I want to feel each day is worthwhile, with a new experience or a new adventure being possible. Something as simple as stargazing or going out skateboarding in a new area in town is the simple pleasure that I really live for.* I like to be a comedian for others. Whether that‚Äôs starting to dance when a catchy song plays and making everyone laugh, or simply getting a smile out of people, I tend to be funny but not necessarily in the Ne random way but more-so accommodating others and being goofy at certain moments that allow me to.* I‚Äôm very creative but I prefer my creativity to be tangible. I actually enjoy writing but I hate writing or reading things that consist of strange universes or alien planets, I love things that have a realistic implication, a story about a real life situation or The Hunger Games which is a realistic dystopia instead of a random planet. A lot of my creativity involves the 5 senses. I love to paint for the sight, dance to feel one and immersed with my body and music, sing to make sounds, and I‚Äôm a pretty good cook even if I don‚Äôt enjoy the tediousness of it at times.* Without sensory experiences I tend to feel very empty. Whenever traveling I look for places to waterski or surf, or anything like a place that has karaoke night. I believe that doing fun things like this with my friends makes life so much more enjoyable than boring museums or just looking at places and not doing anything.* I have very strong morals and I tend to shut down when I see people imposing them. I tend to treat everyone as an individual deserving of the same respect. I am very observant to people‚Äôs emotional states and make an effort to make everyone feel included.* I‚Äôm very good at knowing how I feel and I might sometimes be very aware and sensitive if I‚Äôm being left out. I tend to use these emotions as self expressions and an outlet for creativity. My inner world is the source for my outer expression.* I am described as affable and childlike. I tend to wave my hand frantically with eagerness at someone I know across the street, and enjoy random small talk and conversation with anyone I know whenever I can get it.* I can be very goal oriented and look to the outer world as a guide to becoming better. I tend to measure myself based on external standards such as goals or discipline when it comes to the things I‚Äôm passionate about. I tend to have a desire to be the best I can be at my passions and work to get there. But I‚Äôm pretty lazy most of the time, haha.* I suck at math and I absolutely can‚Äôt stand lectures. When teachers allow us for us to do group work, to be creative with our work and to apply the learning to something I can actually use in my life, I feel really happy and immersed into the subject.* Is this inferior Ni? I hate when people ask me where I see myself in ten years. What I‚Äôm preoccupied with is the experiences I can have now or in the short term future. I don‚Äôt know what I want to do or where I want to be, and it stresses me out. I notice I tend to think of the future in terms of relationships. For example: I want you as my friend in the future, I want this relationship to be our future. But I tend to stop there and when I do think of the future it‚Äôs when I‚Äôm unhealthy and thinking: The future is doomed, the worst outcome is going to happen, the future is going to screw me over. And in these moments I tend to act withdrawn, reclusive, and very aloof, opposite of what I usually am.What makes me lean towards not being an ESFP:&amp;#x200B;* I‚Äôm not a party person at all. I really don‚Äôt like to have shallow relationships and I search for meaningful connections with friends and others around me. I don‚Äôt have the obliviousness to connections and meaningful things the way the descriptions say so.* I definitely can see the abstract meaning behind things and for example can see a relationship being like a flower starting from the dirt and growing out. But I don‚Äôt enjoy having abstract concepts all the time, I need a balance for the simple pleasures of life and analyzing the deep stuff.* I tend to sometimes be aloof and guarded if I don‚Äôt fit in. Sometimes if I feel the people around me are immoral I tend to shut down and act as more of a quiet loner. I‚Äôm not an extrovert hundred percent the time but I‚Äôm very loud and outgoing when I feel comfortable.* I've gotten pretty into MBTI which means I feel maybe my Ni is higher.  I've had a hard time typing myself and for some reason seem to lean between a mix of ENFJ and ESFP during tests with Ne being nonexistent. I feel that me wanting to know who I really am might make me an intuitive, but I personally feel being a sensor is way cooler.* I can be unobservant and spacey.  I notice when I'm bored I tend to have mind fogs where I don't really notice anything around me. I tend to not notice the porch got swept and things being misplaced but I'm also engaged and in touch with fun activities like dancing. I don't really daydream but it's more of a mind fog that I find myself in when I'm bored or not fully engaged in something. It makes me feel like an Ne user especially since I can at times be told to pay attention and that I'm not really 'there', but then when I'm really enjoying something I feel really in tune and attentive to the world. I score very low on Ne, and my highest scores tend to be be Se and Fi with Te following and Ni and Fe following. [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/hnooc1)",Am I an ESFP?

561,ESFP,,What do you guys think of Ni?
562,ESFP,"This is version one. Give some feedback plz. I couldn‚Äôt find something like this online so here we go.   * **Bacchus/Dionysians:**Examples: various pop icons, Kardashians, actors, comedians, fighters, local drug dealers. This is where the party animal stereotype comes from. Fi-&gt;Te in the middle. They're animalistic and often draw a varied party regardless of if they want to. They know what they enjoy and they go after it. That's all. In their mind, they're just tryna make themselves happy and provide a service for people at the time. A great formula for life right? An issue may arise when their happiness takes precedence and they sour on the service part. They may ghost on a moments notice, try self-sabotage, find an easy route, or stabilize their service to provide a steady income if they're more mature. Fifty years ago they'd see all the shows at the theatre, drink the finest wine, and play a relaxing sport. Now... they just go on their phones all day... Though to be fair, who doesn't? Sometimes what they enjoy is not enjoying the stuff other people like. Dislikes are just as strong as likes. You'll see ESFPs who are punk rockers, who don't use social media, who are straight edge, never watched porn in their lives or who claim they don't like people. They almost live for infamy. This should be a whole section on its own...Sometimes what they like is being a Paris Hilton, as we're all aware of. More mature Dionysians can visualize simulations of the near future and plan for it. They usually anchor their Fi to it. It's like this: If I can do a touch of Ni and not fuck myself over, then I can do all the Fi I want. Win-win. The same with all ExxPs, they'll burn everything down if you try to control them. Some can be seen as sellouts, as they want their cake, and to eat it too. Most of the time it's just good business. Some value entertaining overall: Justin Gaethje said he'd rather lose than have a boring fight. This encapsulates the Bacchus spirit in ESFPs. They'd rather win, but the idea of going the boring route for that... just no. Often mistaken for: ESTPs who have an inside joke that they don't care who gets. ENFPs who are less abstract or hippy-ish. ESFJs who aren't obsessed with people.  * **Titan:**Examples: popular ex-military dudes, actors, fitness dudes, firefighters, politicians. Fi is one of the most animalistic functions. One doesn't even need a reason to go after what they want. If they can tap into that single-minded Ni at the bottom and lock onto a goal they're unstoppable. Beings that keep going forward and never stop.Known for those motivational videos on youtube where the guys shouting at you to get out of bed at three fifty-eight in the morning and tie your shoelaces. Your legs are broken? Good. Now get back on that elliptical. They'll go through hell and high water to achieve what they want. The issue being, if they're on the wrong path, they'll go through hell and high water to fall off a cliff. You're one on one against life playing Russian roulette for the holy grail. Think of it like the titans in ‚Äòattack on titan‚Äô, even the titan shifters. They see a goal, they go for it, that's it. They only vary on maturely that attack their targets. They're often less fearful of control as they know it's a necessary part to achieve your goals. More mature titans fear no man, as they're conscious that man is just a bag of flesh and blood. Therefore they can't fear man‚Äôs control and can bust out of it at a moments notice. Often mistaken for: Little more personable and little less tactical ENTJs \[easy to see how they dominate politics\]. ISTPs who care less about the preservation of their physical bodies.  ***Background info:*** *Background about me, I first thought I was an ESTP, then an xNTP before settling on ESFP a couple of years ago.  If there are any more variations you‚Äôve seen, lemme know. I‚Äôd like to add a more introverted variation, and would love to go into more depth regarding ""healthy and unhealthy"".*",ESFP variations

570,ESFP,"Here's for a new audience for this post. Wanted to post some really great anime ESFPs that I think truly are ESFP in my opinion. You probably already guessed and noticing some ESFP and ENFP confusion online since you guys look so alike from each other and everyone has their own opinions which is fine. But I wanted to do this today and share my personal opinion on anime characters that I see that are definitely ESFPs in my opinion and are great and amazing characters as well and very well written too. You guys complain for good reason that the MBTI community doesn't do you justice and stereotypes you guys too often and get prejudged a lot by stereotypes you guys are known for and I feel you.Here are the other MBTI anime characters I made in the past, the INTJ one is my most recent one as of now: [https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/hctvvy/entj\_anime\_characters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/hctvvy/entj_anime_characters/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/hdakhy/enfp\_anime\_characters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/hdakhy/enfp_anime_characters/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/hi9anf/intj\_anime\_characters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/hi9anf/intj_anime_characters/) So I wanted to do this post as a thanks for being awesome and discussion of what anime characters I think are ESFPs for sure and are great characters as well in the anime community. Now I'm gonna get this out of the way, I'll share my opinion on the big ones that people debate often for anime main characters that get debated ENFP vs ESFP in the community. In my opinion I type Goku, Gon Freecss, Luffy, and Naruto ENFPs, I feel they've shown Ne and Si each plenty of times to argue the case for each one and make the case for why their each individually ENFPs. That's my opinion though, if you agree or disagree feel free to share your opinions down below. I'll posts links to posts I've made on them or other people's post on them that I agree with if you want to see evidence for why I think so for each character. I personally see Ash Ketchum ENFP too but that's my opinion as well. Share your opinions down below again if you feel you want to or feel differently about something, I'll post the links down below. But this post isn't about them, it's about other characters that I see in my opinion as awesome ESFPs and great characters that people already know and love or need to talk about more and give more love and attention to and should recognize as awesome ESFP characters, alright enough with the essay I'll post my opinions down below now:&amp;#x200B;Great post on Mario too by the way:[https://www.google.com/amp/s/funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/158027721211/super-mario-brothers-mario-esfp/amp](https://www.google.com/amp/s/funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/158027721211/super-mario-brothers-mario-esfp/amp)&amp;#x200B;My Goku ENFP opinion and analysis:\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku\\\_is\\\_an\\\_enfp\\\_and\\\_heres\\\_why\\\_dragon\\\_ball\\\_z\\\_mbti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku\_is\_an\_enfp\_and\_heres\_why\_dragon\_ball\_z\_mbti/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku\_is\_an\_enfp\_and\_heres\_why\_dragon\_ball\_z\_mbti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku_is_an_enfp_and_heres_why_dragon_ball_z_mbti/))My Gon Freecss ENFP post:\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/d7pprz/why\\\_gon\\\_freecs\\\_is\\\_enfp\\\_and\\\_uses\\\_ne\\\_primarily\\\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/d7pprz/why\_gon\_freecs\_is\_enfp\_and\_uses\_ne\_primarily\_over/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/d7pprz/why\_gon\_freecs\_is\_enfp\_and\_uses\_ne\_primarily\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/d7pprz/why_gon_freecs_is_enfp_and_uses_ne_primarily_over/))A Luffy post I agree with, Me and my ISFJ friend are working on a Luffy ENFP post now together for Reddit, it should be out soon but here's this for now:\[[https://practicaltyping.com/2018/08/31/monkey-d-luffy-enfp/](https://practicaltyping.com/2018/08/31/monkey-d-luffy-enfp/)\]([https://practicaltyping.com/2018/08/31/monkey-d-luffy-enfp/](https://practicaltyping.com/2018/08/31/monkey-d-luffy-enfp/))Naruto, surprisingly I haven't done a Naruto post yet but I know he's ENFP in my opinion and I've been watching the anime again and I see his Ne and Si in the first 7 episodes, I'm gonna make a Naruto post in time once I finish my rewatch and reread so until then I'll just link this post I agree with, tell me what you think on it if you want:\[[https://fictionalcharactermbti.tumblr.com/post/160992147849/hello-i-always-agreed-with-your-typing-of-naruto](https://fictionalcharactermbti.tumblr.com/post/160992147849/hello-i-always-agreed-with-your-typing-of-naruto)\]([https://fictionalcharactermbti.tumblr.com/post/160992147849/hello-i-always-agreed-with-your-typing-of-naruto](https://fictionalcharactermbti.tumblr.com/post/160992147849/hello-i-always-agreed-with-your-typing-of-naruto))Now for the awesome characters I see as clear ESFPs in my opinion, here's my list of all them written out for you guys:Awesome ESFP anime characters:Kuwabara - This man is amazing and one of my favorite anime characters of all time. He's fantastic and relatable and very funny and down to Earth. He has a heart of gold and great morality and has a awesome dynamic between him and Yusuke who's ESTP. Kuwabara is sometimes mistyped ESFJ but no this man is ESFP for sure, he uses Se and Fi all the thime and he's an awesome ESFP anime character at that. Overall great character, gonna make a character analysis on him when the time comes when I get to rewatching Yu Yu Hakusho again.Knuckle - Another great Kuwabara like character, made by Togashi again. Very manly and tough but has a soft side that the show often gets on him for and its very funny side to his character. Again heart of gold and great morality, he loves animals, he helps Gon out even though Gon got mad at him for it, haha. Knuckle is great what more do I need to say, he's an amazing character and one of Togashi's best.Brook - One of the best straw hats from One Piece. One of the best characters in One Piece as well. Most people agree on this, he's amazing and extremely creative idea on Oda's part. He's a talking skeleton with an Afro with a extremely sad backstory but still keeps his sense of humor and is very down to earth as well. He loves to perform and make music and make people laugh and make jokes. He's more practical than Luffy which is a nice touch and is realistic and loyal to Luffy and Laboon. He make his own band and music artist career of sorts which is amazing and hilarious at the same time. He was incredible in the New World especially in the Big Mom arc, anyone that seen the arc knows what I'm talking about. It's Brook what more do I need to say, Soul King will live on forever.Mina Ashido - One of the more newer ones, she's spontaneous and in the moment and loves to dance and party. She likes to break dance and get involved in class activities and likes to get everyone else involved as well in the fun. She's bright and energetic and full of life and has a interesting and unique design to her. Love Mina she's a great character and one of the best characters in class 1-A.Joey Wheeler - Now where do I begin. This guy is a fantastic character and probably started the heart of gold ESFP stereotype first before among all of them. Joey is an awesome character with great morality and tons of funny humor to him as a character as well, its true he started off a bully to Yugi but once they changed and Yugi helped him he never left his side and stayed loyal to him till the end. Joey is great an amazing character and I always loved when he was on screen and the duels he was apart of in the series.Ty Lee - from Avatar she's a rather interesting one. She seems one note at first and just attractive and all that initially. But as the series progressed we learn more about her and her backstory and learn to empathize with her more rather than our first initial impression of her in the beginning when they were around the campfire. She might not seem to important of a character among the cast to some people out of all the Avatar cast but I felt her character was done well enough to mention her here so here you go, Ty Lee is among the greats.Asta - Another newer one from Black Clover. I think Asta is an interesting case for a character so far. I haven't gotten too far in Black Clover so I don't have too much to say about him but from what I've seen I'm starting to like his character more and can see his determination and drive to reach his goals and do whatever it takes to get to where he wants to be to be Wizard King. He's shaping up to be great and more interesting so I wanted to mention him here since I feel he deserved it and it was necessary.Kirishima - One of the best characters in My Hero Academia. He's great and reacts to details around him very quickly and very well. Any type can fight in a physical way but in his case he does have a very physical fighting style is all about offense and defense with his hardness powers. He lives fully in the moment, reacts to details quickly and pays attention to his surroundings and details around him very well, he has strong inner values and is very emotional and has great morality and a heart of gold with his Fi and with his belief in manliness especially when someone does a good deed that he sees as moral and right. Despite his toughness he shows us his vulnerable side and emotions especially in his backstory, he looks up to his favorite hero and follows his philosophy and uses his values to be brave and to keep going. Sometimes is a bit impulsive with his Se but overall still a great character and I can't wait to see more from him as we all know and are looking forward too with his character. Red Riot will be a beast and awesome good hero. Here's a great post on Kirishima if you want to read more about him:&amp;#x200B;Mario - Super Mario, this is a video game character but I'll mention him here anyway. Where do I even begin, he's the biggest video game character in the world and his jumping and Se has changed the world forever in video game history. He follows his heart with his Fi and he lives to jump and perform for us as Jumpman for years to come in countless Mario games that we love to play no matter how many times we do it. His Se helps him jump and respond to details in the environment perfectly which is why he's the best debatably video game character ever made. It's Mario, he's awesome, we all now this. Let's love him and enjoy his character forever in all time.Ino - The Naruto series isn't known for developing its characters the best out of the bunch but despite this Naruto is still a great series despite its flaws and I think Ino is still a great character among the cast. She bonded really well with her team, Shikamaru and Chouji. They make a really good team and she has an interesting dynamic and rivalry with Sakura. She had a lot of good in the Chuunin Exam forest and I believe had some great fights later as well from memory. Overall Ino is a great and solid character and I felt she should be mentioned here as well.Forgive me if your a Fairy Tail fan, I'm gonna critique this one more. I don't think this next one is well written but I figured I'd mention him since he's popular:Natsu Dragoneel, one of the weaker ones for sure. Not the most well written and one of the worst shonen characters in my opinion. If you like him that's fine, I'll respect your opinion of him. But Natsu is definitely ESFP and should be mentioned here anywayRenji from Bleach, another great ESFP characterSailor Venus, another awesome ESFP characterBlack Star from Soul Eater, another great ESFP character again, hahaMajin BuuMr. 2 Bon ClayIvankovAlvida from One Piece as wellMinoru MinetaYuga AoyamaMt.

571,ESFP,"Been dating an esfp. It‚Äôs been going very well. Never had a more genuine heart connection to someone before.We both are older and have discussed our most recent dating experiences. Mainly, because he has asked me about mine. I have never asked about his dating past because...idk, it‚Äôs just not important to me. But on one occasion he started giving me his ‚Äúhistory‚Äù of exes and why it didn‚Äôt work. It was odd. Like he had to get it all out or something. I was confused and asked him, what I should take from this info? Should I read into this? He said no, I shouldn‚Äôt and he was telling me just to tell me. (Ok...)The info wasn‚Äôt completely flattering to him (imo) as it sounded like he just went with people who liked him a lot. For instance he was with the latest ex because she ‚Äúreally liked him‚Äù and it ended because he realized he didn‚Äôt love her. The only person who he actively said he liked, he described as ‚Äúmean to everyone but him‚Äù and eventually that temper was what ended things.I asked him if he even knew what he wanted. I told him I was easy going with building something but I was looking for something real and didn‚Äôt want my time wasted. Took him aback. He seemed oddly pleased with that answer but didn‚Äôt say anything more. Anyway, we‚Äôre going on a trip together, his idea. Cool! Maybe it‚Äôs my own insecurity - fair admit but on another occasion he showed me some vacation pics from his travels and just lots of these different exes in them. I guess it made me uncomfortable, even though it shouldn‚Äôt? Guess I felt like it took away from the trip we had planned- like he was low key telling me it wasn‚Äôt that special. Does this with everyone. Anyone shed light on this? Am I being weird here?? Lol. Dated a lot of people and never had someone be that open about their exes.",Esfp and past dating

578,ESFP,"My husband (INFP) and I (ESFP) have been learning a lot about what our personality types clash with each other on. For example, at his work he‚Äôs had the opportunity to move to a supervisory position, which he has no interest in. A lot of our squabbles comes from me pushing him to move down that path whereas he simply has no interest in controlling/having power over people. I see it as ESFP‚Äôs are practical thinkers who convey their thoughts pretty bluntly and directly, which for a sensitive, altruistic INFP can be a big turn off.",What is your SO‚Äôs type?

580,ESFP,"Apparently INTPs have Se Polr. I've noticed this in myself, and it basically means that I find it really really impossibly hard to push an idea onto someone, push someone to do something, or command someone to do something. I can't even process the mechanism to do it. I either come off as agreeable and just let people be, or I'm viewed as a pushy asshole. Yet, I see sensor types act rude and pushy as fuck in my POV, and yet no sensor blinks an eye. In fact, the intuitive types that get offended by the rudeness are viewed as the rude ones. It's actually fucked. As someone in a sensor-majority society, how can I master this greatest weakness of mine and toe the line just right in being commanding?","I've noticed that when sensors are being pushy, everyone is okay with it, because they can toe the line just right. Intuitive types might get offended, but all the other sensor types find the behavior acceptable. It's very strange seeing it in real time. As an INTP, how can I learn to do this?"
581,ESFP,"Hello, guys!!!A question has been bothering me that you may answer, I think: my MBTI type. I've been typed so many times as an ESFP or even an ENFP that my head hurts, and I'm still confused. Read descriptions, read accounts, could relate to Ne doms more, and didn't feel as though i am  more sensual Se dom like, I'm very very childish and flower power, ambiverted, plus a total airhead. I've been compared as a child to Belle, Angelina Jolie (who was a total role model for me) or Lara Croft, and nowadays to Melissa McCarthy in her various films, like Tammy being a great example, or to a puppy, to Hermione Granger or to the great Carrie Fisher. Is it because of the functions of a Se dom that I think I'm a Ne dom?? I'm actually very very unsure of how I work, because I don't remember what I do exactly, I always move on, although I've been told I can seem sometimes stuck and or unwilling to change, but that's a very very diffiicult subject which is pretty personal to me. I'm not sure what I do in times of stress. Sometimes I search for the loops and grips, but I don't really remember what I do. I had recently a very very unhealthy moment where I was afraid of the future, had this certain vision and I shut down, plus attacked people  INFJ-style by saying ""people are only dating and have friends because they don't know how else to raise/feed their self-esteem.I feel as though I am very honest, sometimes not, that I know I subconciously have an image that I have to keep up with, although I feel like myself, I know how the world will react, even if I want total honesty and control, which may lead to my confusion over MBTI and feeling as though I never answered honestly. Plus not knowing my effing Enneagram.Is ir possible that I am a more ENFP-ish Se dom? I just feel so down and I can't fit in no matter what description I read, so I figured I might just as well ask you guys. I can answer a lot of questions about me, in case.What do y'all think?",Might I truly be an ESFP pretending to be ENFP or just a dumbass other type? Or simply ENFP? Or an actual ESTP that is more mellow?

586,ESFP,"Ok. Just a quick rant. I‚Äôm not sure why people keep calling Naruto an ENFP or an ENTP...He is clearly an ESFP from the very first episode! Impulsive, just having fun, doesn‚Äôt care that the class gets punished for his misbehavior (not N), caught up in the moment, motivated by food (cleaning the graffiti better for some ramen) and emotion (will do his best for someone that truly cares about him), does anything for attention...Super ESFP, an immature one, nonetheless he will grow I‚Äôm sure. And for some reason people don‚Äôt think ESFP‚Äôs can be driven or have depth. So therefore they type him as the others once he gets serious. Haha.","Naruto, an ESFP!"
587,ESFP,,"I feel obligated to repost this here, we must spread ESFPmemes awareness!!!"
588,ESFP,"I have taken the 16p AND Dario personality tests and they both come back with strong ESFP.I forgot to look at the other stuff though cause I was just trying to figure out where I belong lol.My fianc√© is a hard ENFP and he just got this book about his personality and he really wants to know mine. So he can better understand how I think.At first I thought I was a cusp of something between ESFP AND ENFP but now I see that they are particularly similar. However, there are a few things that trip me up, first is the relationships, yes I do have some flaky relationships and I HAVE hopped from one boyfriend to another but I now have found my other half. Like we literally call each other our twin. Maybe because we have a very open and honest relationship with each other and not to mention sex life is AMAZEBALLS. I digress...The other thing that I have read was ESFP personality types aren‚Äôt that creative? But I am extremely creative (arts and crafts etc.) not at all a numbers or planning person and I DEFINITELY cannot see the bigger picture in anything and it really pisses my fianc√© off sometimes lol along with my constant forgetfulness. I also love cheesy dad jokes! Like this one:What‚Äôs the difference between a hippo and a zippo lighter?Ones a little heavy the other is a little lighter LOLAlso my fianc√© does always say that I don‚Äôt listen to him and that‚Äôs not true at all. I do, I just forget things. A lot. I also roast him quite a bit which he doesn‚Äôt like either lol but he takes it and even throws some back, but when he does it he usually attacks (or seems to me) my learning disability (dyslexia) it‚Äôs usually all in fun but deep down it does sting a little.With jobs I have done various things in my life and have various degrees and certificates but none of them really brought me much joy, except for a sales job that I had but my boss was wicked chill and he knew my love language really well (words of affirmation). Something that I am interested in pursuing someday when all my other debt is paid off though is cosmetology because it‚Äôs like art, I can be creative. Another thing that didn‚Äôt totally match up is confrontation. I guess I do like to avoid confrontation with the people I care about as much as possible but if I don‚Äôt know you on a personal level or if I don‚Äôt care about you I have no problem getting into an argument or fist fight if you have hurt someone close to me. For example: If we are at the bar and my friend is being bothered by someone I will not hesitate to protect my friend, even if they don‚Äôt speak up about it and I can just tell by their body language. I have been in lots of fights this way and I don‚Äôt discriminate I WILL FIGHT YOU lol (I am female so no hate plz lol.) However, if I get in to an argument with my fianc√© (which RARELY happens) I always end up crying, and forget confrontation with my mom. I WILL not, it makes me extremely uncomfortable, I will agree with her on almost everything she says, even her extremely right wing political views (which not to mention I hate politics with a fiery passion.) I can be a little confrontational with my dad but he has always been in and out of my life so it‚Äôs kinda not the best relationship...So I guess my question is... am I an ESFP?",I think I have found my personality type... unsure though.
589,ESFP,"The generalization I get from reading Internet blogs on ESFPs is that we are the office politics kings and queens. But the reality is, I absolutely loathe and fear office politics. The bitching, moaning, back-biting and gossiping, all to get one-up-man-ship, really gets to me and is so super negative.  I like to keep my head down and get on with work (I work in a tech role), but find the gossiping and negative jibes around me get me down.

600,ESFP,"TL;DR - INTJ visiting looking for some help, or at least perspective, trying to make my marriage of 17 years with ESFP work.Note: We have both had individual (frequently) and couple counseling (periodically) throughout our marriage.\---------------So, first off, I want to say that I love my wife and think that she's a wonderful person. She alternates between ESFP and ENFP and I recognize both types in her.¬† I love her energy and enthusiasm in exploring new ideas and experiences with me!¬† She is often remarkably compassionate and selfless with our kids.¬† Her willingness to challenge my beliefs/thinking and to advocate for me and my wellbeing when I struggle to do so for myself are invaluable.From what I understand of ESFPs, this may not be a very popular post, but I'm hoping you can help me communicate better with my wife. We've got a lot of circumstances working against us. This year has not been kind to us financially, with my worsening health threatening my ability to work (as a workaholic trying to do better), many thousands of dollars of medical bills mounting trying to find a diagnosis/treatment, and $10k+ of fraud and theft from our renovation contractor.My wife, as gracious as she is, can be really¬† one-sided or even petty when she talks to others about people she is upset with, particularly if she feels that they have crossed her or rejected her in some way.¬† Sooner or later she gets really upset with me and our marriage.Don't get me wrong, I make lots of mistakes and do/say things that make me hard to live with sometimes. The only real mitigating factor is that I really do try to never be an asshole, am genuinely open to criticism, and work hard to change behavior and even attitudes once I understand the effect of what I'm doing or saying. Change is hard and isn't immediate, especially if I don't understand what the issue is or how to change it at first, but I do change. I'm grateful that she's helped me learn how to be a better person through our conflicts.So, here's the thing, whenever this happens she tells me that it happened because she was talking with someone else who told her she was being mistreated, and then when she thinks back on some past interactions she gets really angry.¬† I've come to recognize that I suck at picking up on emotional cues, so this always blindsides me.¬† I've tried asking her periodically how she's feeling or if she's happy in our marriage, but even days before the blow-up she responds that she's happy. Additionally, asking seems to annoy her, particularly if there is any frequency.Another major communication barrier is that when I try to talk with her to find a resolution to a disagreement, she often feels like I'm being manipulative or dismisses my perspective out of hand as being unrealistic or otherwise invalid.¬†I am typically very open to the possibility that I'm wrong, and am even grateful for being proven wrong so that I can start being ""not-wrong."" I honestly don't feel like I'm trying to be manipulative.¬†Because I don't understand what I can change in my approach to be effective, I've come to feel like I don't have a voice in our marriage and end up constantly sacrificing my needs and aspirations to help support her being in another play, getting a new pet, etc.¬† Don't get me wrong, I love to see her shine, but eventually my inner, emotional self rebels against my overwhelmed logical exterior and I blow up. I don't yell or call her names, but I get angry and critical of what she's done (or not done) that I feel pushed me over my stress limit. I inherited an instinctive scowl from my dad (that is REALLY hard for me to control) that can, in itself, be abusive.How do you get through these kinds of hurdles? How do you set boundaries in your marriage that keep anyone from feeling controlled or responsible for making things work that they may think are impossible?Thanks for sticking with me through this long post!¬† I love her and really want to make this work, but with our current life pressures, we can't go on as we have before.","Making marriage work (m) INTJ, (f) ESFP"

602,ESFP,"My ESFP girlfriend hasn't finished her work thats 2 months late and because of this we've only hung out once during quarantine until her parents got a report card and grounded her, on top of this we started dating spring break and during the quarantine school year her parents kept her away from seeing anyone. I've made it clear I want to see her, why isnt she working?! How can I tell that she cares for me?! Any insight? My romantic life is a flat line for the most part because I REALLY like someone in order for anything to happen. I don't want to break up with her but it's like I've done everything in my power to be supportive and also schedule anything to do together, rn I'm just not texting till she sends a text and I'm curious how long that'll be.

603,ESFP,"Wanted to post some really great anime ESFPs that I think truly are ESFP in my opinion. You probably already guessed and noticing some ESFP and ENFP confusion online since you guys look so alike from each other and everyone has their own opinions which is fine. But I wanted to do this today and share my personal opinion on anime characters that I see that are definitely ESFPs in my opinion and are great and amazing characters as well and very well written too. You guys complain for good reason that the MBTI community doesn't do you justice and stereotypes you guys too often and get prejudged a lot by stereotypes you guys are known for and I feel you.So I wanted to do this post as a thanks for being awesome and discussion of what anime characters I think are ESFPs for sure and are great characters as well in the anime community. Now I'm gonna get this out of the way, I'll share my opinion on the big ones that people debate often for anime main characters that get debated ENFP vs ESFP in the community. In my opinion I type Goku, Gon Freecss, Luffy, and Naruto ENFPs, I feel they've shown Ne and Si each plenty of times to argue the case for each one and make the case for why their each individually ENFPs. That's my opinion though, if you agree or disagree feel free to share your opinions down below. I'll posts links to posts I've made on them or other people's post on them that I agree with if you want to see evidence for why I think so for each character. I personally see Ash Ketchum ENFP too but that's my opinion as well. Share your opinions down below again if you feel you want to or feel differently about something, I'll post the links down below. But this post isn't about them, it's about other characters that I see in my opinion as awesome ESFPs and great characters that people already know and love or need to talk about more and give more love and attention to and should recognize as awesome ESFP characters, alright enough with the essay I'll post my opinions down below now:My Goku ENFP opinion and analysis:[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku\_is\_an\_enfp\_and\_heres\_why\_dragon\_ball\_z\_mbti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku_is_an_enfp_and_heres_why_dragon_ball_z_mbti/)My Gon Freecss ENFP post:[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/d7pprz/why\_gon\_freecs\_is\_enfp\_and\_uses\_ne\_primarily\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/d7pprz/why_gon_freecs_is_enfp_and_uses_ne_primarily_over/)A Luffy post I agree with, Me and my ISFJ friend are working on a Luffy ENFP post now together for Reddit, it should be out soon but here's this for now:[https://practicaltyping.com/2018/08/31/monkey-d-luffy-enfp/](https://practicaltyping.com/2018/08/31/monkey-d-luffy-enfp/)Naruto, surprisingly I haven't done a Naruto post yet but I know he's ENFP in my opinion and I've been watching the anime again and I see his Ne and Si in the first 7 episodes, I'm gonna make a Naruto post in time once I finish my rewatch and reread so until then I'll just link this post I agree with, tell me what you think on it if you want:[https://fictionalcharactermbti.tumblr.com/post/160992147849/hello-i-always-agreed-with-your-typing-of-naruto](https://fictionalcharactermbti.tumblr.com/post/160992147849/hello-i-always-agreed-with-your-typing-of-naruto)Now for the awesome characters I see as clear ESFPs in my opinion, here's my list of all them written out for you guys:Awesome ESFP anime characters:Kuwabara - This man is amazing and one of my favorite anime characters of all time. He's fantastic and relatable and very funny and down to Earth. He has a heart of gold and great morality and has a awesome dynamic between him and Yusuke who's ESTP. Kuwabara is sometimes mistyped ESFJ but no this man is ESFP for sure, he uses Se and Fi all the thime and he's an awesome ESFP anime character at that. Overall great character, gonna make a character analysis on him when the time comes when I get to rewatching Yu Yu Hakusho again.Knuckle - Another great Kuwabara like character, made by Togashi again. Very manly and tough but has a soft side that the show often gets on him for and its very funny side to his character. Again heart of gold and great morality, he loves animals, he helps Gon out even though Gon got mad at him for it, haha. Knuckle is great what more do I need to say, he's an amazing character and one of Togashi's best.Brook - One of the best straw hats from One Piece. One of the best characters in One Piece as well. Most people agree on this, he's amazing and extremely creative idea on Oda's part. He's a talking skeleton with an Afro with a extremely sad backstory but still keeps his sense of humor and is very down to earth as well. He loves to perform and make music and make people laugh and make jokes. He's more practical than Luffy which is a nice touch and is realistic and loyal to Luffy and Laboon. He make his own band and music artist career of sorts which is amazing and hilarious at the same time. He was incredible in the New World especially in the Big Mom arc, anyone that seen the arc knows what I'm talking about. It's Brook what more do I need to say, Soul King will live on forever.Mina Ashido - One of the more newer ones, she's spontaneous and in the moment and loves to dance and party. She likes to break dance and get involved in class activities and likes to get everyone else involved as well in the fun. She's bright and energetic and full of life and has a interesting and unique design to her. Love Mina she's a great character and one of the best characters in class 1-A.Joey Wheeler - Now where do I begin. This guy is a fantastic character and probably started the heart of gold ESFP stereotype first before among all of them. Joey is an awesome character with great morality and tons of funny humor to him as a character as well, its true he started off a bully to Yugi but once they changed and Yugi helped him he never left his side and stayed loyal to him till the end. Joey is great an amazing character and I always loved when he was on screen and the duels he was apart of in the series.Ty Lee - from Avatar she's a rather interesting one. She seems one note at first and just attractive and all that initially. But as the series progressed we learn more about her and her backstory and learn to empathize with her more rather than our first initial impression of her in the beginning when they were around the campfire. She might not seem to important of a character among the cast to some people out of all the Avatar cast but I felt her character was done well enough to mention her here so here you go, Ty Lee is among the greats.Asta - Another newer one from Black Clover. I think Asta is an interesting case for a character so far. I haven't gotten too far in Black Clover so I don't have too much to say about him but from what I've seen I'm starting to like his character more and can see his determination and drive to reach his goals and do whatever it takes to get to where he wants to be to be Wizard King. He's shaping up to be great and more interesting so I wanted to mention him here since I feel he deserved it and it was necessary.Mario - Super Mario, this is a video game character but I'll mention him here anyway. Where do I even begin, he's the biggest video game character in the world and his jumping and Se has changed the world forever in video game history. He follows his heart with his Fi and he lives to jump and perform for us as Jumpman for years to come in countless Mario games that we love to play no matter how many times we do it. His Se helps him jump and respond to details in the environment perfectly which is why he's the best debatably video game character ever made. It's Mario, he's awesome, we all now this. Let's love him and enjoy his character forever in all time.Ino - The Naruto series isn't known for developing its characters the best out of the bunch but despite this Naruto is still a great series despite its flaws and I think Ino is still a great character among the cast. She bonded really well with her team, Shikamaru and Chouji. They make a really good team and she has an interesting dynamic and rivalry with Sakura. She had a lot of good in the Chuunin Exam forest and I believe had some great fights later as well from memory. Overall Ino is a great and solid character and I felt she should be mentioned here as well.Mention anymore down below if you feel I missed any. I'll probably add more to the list in time too myself.

INXJ here, big fan.I've been friends with an awesome ESFP for years now, and I thought it would be interesting to talk about both the complexities of ESFP-XNXX relationships. I'd love to hear your thoughts!I've never had a better adventure buddy than my ESFP friend. We've travelled all over the world together, and her spontaneity, enthusiasm, and present-ness are a great complement to my eagerness to explore the new and different. As a J, I help make our plans a bit easier to execute, and as a P she helps me be more flexible, as is often needed!We both love the arts and history, so we go to the opera and museums and watch documentaries together. I feel this deep connection to the emotional significance of art, and the different perspectives on the world offered up by history stoke my imagination and curiosity. I think she experiences a somewhat different version of delight, though the exact nature of it eludes me...We have a deep affection for one another, but it's still hard for us to connect at surface level sometimes. I tend to try to connect to others by sharing feelings and innermost thoughts, and she has trouble relating to that. She likes to keep things light. I think it's important for me to take her affection for granted, although she doesn't always show it in ways that I expect. Our biggest hurdle is that she prefers to avoid direct confrontation and pushes down her feelings to keep things fun and light. I can't read the nonverbal cues she gives when she's bothered, and I continue bothering her! We've been discussing this lately, and I'd love to hear any suggestions about how to be a friend that better suits her personality.Keep being beautiful ESFPs, and thanks for reading!",ESFPs and Intuitives

607,ESFP,"so there's this ESFP girl my age (mid 20's) that i work with... long story short, we connected and related pretty well last summer, but she had to back away because she was in a relationship with a super protective guy... and I also came on a bit strong.For the next like 8 months i respected her space and didn't really converse with her at all with conversations outside of work-related topics.Anyways, within the past two weeks they broke up... I saw her at work in the break room and asked her how she had been..She looked sad and her body language seemed very hurt due to the breakup... I then asked her if she wanted to talk sometime, and she said ""oookayyyy...""I didn't want to force the issue so I deviated to something casaul and asked her what she's eating, then said ""see ya around!"" and left...Looking back I think i should've asked her if she wanted to get coffee, but didn't want to capitalize on her vulnerability and think I should wait a bit before asking her....Yet I also want to ask her to get coffee, maybe she wants someone to be there for her.

609,ESFP,"Hi, so I'm an ENFP and I've been really good friends with an ESFP girl (I'm a guy) for 2 years now. I've always though she was really beautiful and we get along super well, and I think while I've been denying it to myself, I may have had a crush on her for awhile now. And tbh I'm not sure what to do about it, and a lot would depend on how she felt. She's def my best female friend and I'd be happy keeping it that way if I thought that was for the best, but I've always wondered if I might surprisingly have a chance with her, for quite a lot of reasons. So early on when I knew her, she stumbled into my room drunk, wanted us to go hang out on my bed, and said something about whether I wanted to do something unexpected, but at that point she was only a friend to me so I didn't think it was worth finding out what exactly that all meant. Idk if thats just standard ESFP behavior but at the time I felt pretty sure where that all was headed. She's literally told me she tends to go for taller thiner guys, in other words me to a t, so I guess that helps too.Despite me being more shy than most extraverts she's tried to get me to do things with her, which I love as it gets me out of my comfort zones and makes having fun way easier. If I actually want to just hang out with her, however, I always have had to be the one reaching out, until more recently (before the virus) when she finally started reaching out too. We also go out to parties together quite a lot especially recently, we both love drunk/high dancing so much. One thing thats happened a couple of times is we'll just be dancing and she'll be like ""just pretend to be my bf"" and then she'll kiss me a bunch (only on the cheek I think), always saying that she's warding off interested guys. For most people that would be a sign if it happens a few times, I think, but with her who knows. I mean she does like to use people as human pillows whenever possible so she doesn't exactly shy away from random physical contact. She's always been super straightforward with guys, but also really shies away from anything like real feelings, which maybe doesn't help me much?  Anyways, there a few things here that always made me think about what she meant by them, and whether that was just something reflecting her personality, or if it meant more, and I figured you guys might have some ideas as ESFPs. And thanks if u took the time to read this big mess of randomness, its much appreciated!","hey ESFP's, do I have a chance here and whats going on?"

Not to say I‚Äôm a psychopath, because I can tell you I cry at anything that makes me happy, sad, or angry real easily.

But when it boiled down to some of our arguments (consisting of my INTP ex boyfriend constantly berating himself and me trying to assure him that I loved him,) I took a step back eventually and really thought about the weight of the phrase.And I realized that I didn‚Äôt love him. Which is crazy because I just said I don‚Äôt know what love is like, but I know I didn‚Äôt love him because I started growing impatient and tired of having to pick him up on a daily basis. (Its really terrible of me to say that, but that is what I felt because even if I had a rough day, I always had to shift my focus away from myself.) On top of that, I realized that I didn‚Äôt feel any spark when I was with him, and (a bit TMI but whatever,) kissing just felt bland. Boring.Nowadays I have a lot of superficial crushes based off of appearance and occasional levels of attention the other gives me. I usually get over it because I just realize that I don‚Äôt genuinely like/love them like that. Do you think it‚Äôs because I have yet to experience love?

639,ESFP,"Hello everyone, ENTP male here enneagram 4w3 sensitive and more feelings than your average thinker and I constantly match with ESFP (the Se Fi face /eyes are easy to spot) women on dating apps like tinder and okcupid. What are some actually good topics and questions ESFP like to talk about to open up and connect? Sometimes I can start the conversation well but I can't figure out how to keep it going. I've slowly learned over time about not going heavy on the theory talk. This post isn't exactly about just trying to get with ESFP women but more as I get older I notice I can't spend all day in ""Intuition Land"" if I want to connect with other people who are not intuitive perceivers. This is more about working on my sensing for when I do have to be present in the real world and communicate effectively with others.",What are some good starter questions to get ESFP women to open up?

I got money from him for my birthday which he didn't paypal until the evening of my birthday.

She and I texted every couple of months, and she‚Äôs very responsive and friendly through text, almost going out of her way to add a personal touch to our messages (like mentioning things we‚Äôd talked about months ago). I asked her to get drinks a couple of times, but she always seems to have other plans and doesn‚Äôt propose an alternate date. What gives? I‚Äôm getting mixed signals. If she‚Äôs not interested, then why make a point of asking to speak directly to me (just to say ‚Äúhi‚Äù) at my office (including pulling me out of client meetings) and why add so many personal details to the text messages?

661,ESFP,"For some reason, I always meet a bunch of people I end up friends with who are not down. They're introverted, don't know how to have fun, and stay at home more than they go out. I told this friend I have that people would like her a lot more if she was more of a down person.There has been another time too with a different friend who I'm no longer friends with where it was always a struggle getting her to do things with me because she wasn't a down person. Anyway, I was talking to my friend who I don't see that often anymore. I told her that I don't like how most of the time when we hang out, we're always doing the same stuff that we did in the past. This stuff includes either going to each others' house to watch movies and bake, grab a drink around the mall and just walk around, or get lunch/dinner at a restaurant and chat.My friend said that she's more of an introvert who prefers doing simpler things. I then told her that it's mostly just dependent on whether or not she wants to go out and do different things. She didn't have much to say to this part, so I stopped talking about it for a bit. However I was still thinking about all the friends I have and how none of them are down to do things that are more fun like rave, party, go to clubs, bar hop, travel, go on road trips, and hit up Vegas.Since I was getting annoyed thinking about this, I decided to ask that same friend if she ever feels like life is just passing her by. She repeated again that she's just really simple, so she prefers staying home or just doing relaxing things if she does go out with friends.I mentioned that to me it seems like if people aren't going out an experiencing a bunch of fun things, it's like their life is just passing by with nothing meaningful like it's a waste. She said it seemed like I was judging her, but I was simply asking her a question then adding in my own input.What do you ESFPs think about this situation?

701,ESFP,"I am sharing this here because I am really interested on the type of response that I may get and also unloading my conscience. This at the expense of exposure, which hurts but the lesson is more valuable than pain so here it goes: I am in a tight spot in my life right now. I don¬¥t know if I can pay next month¬¥s rent. I left my country in an attempt to put my life back in order. I am struggling to finally put my health on check.   Today I got a little breather from the stress and suddenly a lot of emotional baggage I have been neglecting came rushing back. The last 4 hours I have been emotionally introspecting and talking to myself seriously, like a father voices his concerns to a son. I have been introspecting about my past relations with my friends and how selfish I was. Selfish to the point I could not see how these friends of mine related to other people. I just cared about me and them. everyone else was in the way. I got to the point why I was being selfish. I was using them to satisfy my social needs in return they would satisfy theirs. Being solely focused on hour hobbies, that was all we could satisfy. But I was always waiting for the relationship to become something more than that. I think that I would rather become more attached to someone rather than to find someone else.  In attempts to make stronger bonds I quickly realized resistance from their part. After trying multiple times I soon got over it. But still I was not finding reliable substitutes for these people, so I stayed by their side. I never was socially savvy, my best bet was to wait for them to change. Obviously that never happened. Meanwhile we were enabling each other to live or teenage lives with each other. Our meetings were that time when we could get out our awkward personality without being judged. Years passed, we were still meeting ritualistically. I always stayed near my parents house but most of my friends went abroad to study or work. I feel that ,for them, our meetings were just a nice throwback to spice life a little bit. But for me it was different. I still regarded this people as my best friends, despite only seeing them a couple weeks per year. I got stuck on getting closer to them, while they clearly got away from me.After some testing to see if they would notice absence, my emotional inner child was convinced this people did not mean much to me anymore. I was alone for years without realizing. With no friends and a bad relationship with my stepdad I decided to leave my country and commit social suicide. I have met a lot of people besides my friends but I never regarded them as my friends because I had my ""real friends"" coming next summer. After all, I had no significant relations with anybody because my heart was filled with this hollow memories of the past. Holding on the the idea of friends because I was afraid of looking for new pals.Here I am, all alone, writing this, poking a social network to see if it jerks. I hope this has made you think about the space you have in your heart. It is not limited and you have to organize and clean it up before you put something new in it. I have my conclusion of all of this, but I think it would egotistical to not let you think about your own conclusion as well.Find some peace of mind and clean your heart,  JC",Time for feels

711,ESFP,"So I'm using a throwaway because the ESFP I like occasionally pops by here and might see this. But I, let's just say on the introverted side, happen to really, really like this person, and a relationship is very possible as I have very good reason to assume they like me as well (for the purposes of this, assume that we will get into a relationship please).That being said, are there any tips or advice that would be good for me to know? I really want this relationship to work (I'd be using curse words to back this up were I not wanting to keep this a little calmer and collected) and I think I've been doing somewhat well and I also think I have a good idea of what to do. However, due to circumstances as well as my private nature, this is my first relationship, which is not the same for theirs, so the pressure is really on, and I'm scared my inexperience is going to ruin it! So again, I'm really nervous, so any and all advice would be incredibly appreciated!To anyone who does help or provide any advice, I'd love to thank you in advance!(Lastly, though I've done what I can to avoid giving away many identifying details and change my style up a bit, I still am likely too obvious to them to remain unknown to them.

712,ESFP,"I can't figure out my friend's type* Looks very cold and unapproachable at first impression. She doesn't speak much and hardly initiates meeting a person first. However once you get to know her a little longer, she'll slowly begin to show her real side. She's actually a really playful, silly girl who laughs at almost everything and enjoys joking around with people. * She's a bit reserved and struggles with acting cute or cheesy. * Although it's very against the culture where she lives to the point of it being a taboo, she got many piercings and tattoos at the age of 15. She has her entire back tattooed with something she designed on her own. * She enjoys drawing and is very good at it. She also loves singing, writing her own songs, playing the guitar, acting, and dancing. She initially majored in art while in college before switching to some sort of communications major. * Her dream is to become a famous singer and she said she'll never stop chasing after her dreams and what she wants in life. * Extremely hard-working and focused on her goals. Her discipline is really good and she works hard to the point of tiring out her own body and getting stressed. Even then, she still tries to stop at nothing until she achieves her goals. * Although she looks like someone who's afraid of nothing and tough, she's not as fearless and strong as people perceive her. She admitted that she's scared that she hasn't worked hard enough, that there are things she hasn't completed perfectly, and that she has disappointed everyone who likes her by not meeting their expectations. * She used to barely have any friends at all because she was afraid of getting hurt and she's on the shyer side. Although she barely had friends, she always wished that she could have a lot of friends. On her birthday every year, she would feel sad, lonely, and anxious because she wouldn't have anyone who would celebrate it with her. * Even though she wants to have a lot of friends since she's never had many and has always been a lone-wolf type of girl, she's definitely an introvert who enjoys staying at home.* She's pretty good at putting up a front when she's about to cry. However there are times where it's quite easy to see she's almost going to cry. Sometimes her mood flips within seconds, such as this one time where she was laughing then heard a comment. Immediately her mood flipped and you could see her lip trembling and her eyes starting to water. However the person expanded on their comment and said it was a joke then she immediately started smiling widely again. * She likes putting a twist on things and making them different. For example, she enjoys singing but when doing a cover of a song, she likes putting her own spin on it to make the cover a little different. * She claims that she's fast-paced and impatient. I don't really see it, but I suppose she could be on the impatient side. * She wants to bring everyone positivity and happiness. She tries to ignore anyone who dislikes her because she wants to stay happy and hopes everyone else is happy too.* Pressure helps motivate her * She can enjoy compliments just like everyone else can, but what she cares most about is criticism. Once someone criticizes her, she puts all her focus on that and tries her best to improve. She can be pretty hard on herself.* She says she's a straightforward person; however, she's more gentle depending on who the person is. For example, she's less straightforward with some of her softer friends because she's afraid she could possibly hurt their feelings, which she doesn't want to do.* She knows how to cut hair and has spent a lot of time cutting other friends' hair too. She enjoys doing her nails and makeup. She has dyed her hair a shade of pink before and currently has burgundy hair.* Very non-judgmental; she can be friends with anybody and doesn't care about what they do or what they like. * She once said something about not being the same person you originally were after going through a rainstorm, and that she hopes people can know her as someone with more possibilities.","ESFP, ISFP, ESTJ, something else?"

733,ESFP,"I'm a university student and I just finished my first year... it was super rough. And there's at least 7 more years of this to come. I recently just figured out I was an ESFP and didn't even realize all these cool things about my personality that never shawn because I've been depressed and anxious for the last 11 years. In high school, I had trouble concentrating and focusing on the task at hand, I'd get bored, it would take me forever to complete the task, I would procrastinate to the max, make careless mistakes, would get easily distracted, had trouble committing to things due to short attention span... these were indicative of inattentive ADHD according to my psychiatrist, so I tried an ADHD med. It make me dumber, crazy, and extremely emotional. So I stopped that one and tried another one. The other one did nothing. Tried another one. It made me anxious and gave me heart palpitations. Tried another one. Did nothing, and now I was out of options.Conclusion: 4 ADHD medications tried, nothing worked; I didn't have ADHD and no one knew what my problem was. I thought maybe it was depression and anxiety that made me like this, and maybe that's true, but recently I've been feeling a lot better and have had a much more optimistic view of life (this is not to say I'm cured , it doesn't work that way, but I may be on a good path) and I don't spend most of my days in bed anymore! So I found out I was an ESFP not too long ago (it's so spot on it's kinda creepy), and two of the flaws suggest that we are unfocused and easily bored. That is literally one of my biggest problems - I always end up doing what I want to do in any given moment (and it's usually wayyy more fun than what I should be doing) Or if I do sit down and study, I get distracted with small details like making my notes look perfect and aesthetically pleasing, so I often rewrite things and that takes a considerable amount of time out of my study time. And then I get bored, so I tell myself its time to take a break. Then I get buried into the other thing I'm doing during my break. My time management skills are shit, but I was able to coast through high school cause it wasn't too difficult for me but university was a shit show! And I'm aiming for professional programs so the next several years are going into schooling, but I have to do really well in school if I wanna graduate and have a career :')So I'm asking, how have you guys managed to make yourselves stay focused? I think that might be the biggest thing I need to work on, cause if I remain focused I'll get it done quicker. Sorry for the big wall of text! TL;DR: I have trouble staying focused, following through with a plan for the day because I just end up doing whatever I want, and it takes me forever to do something probably because I try really hard to make it look nice rather than actually getting it done (this is most applicable to taking notes - I spend more time making it look pretty rather than learning the material). These have affected my school performance because I have no time management skills and some of the ESFP flaws are uncontrolled on my part. There's several more years of schooling for me and I need to find a way to fix these and would love some tips from you guys!","Any ESFPs studying for a long time?

As a child I was very innocent and bubbly but by the time my mid teens came I learned how to be more strong willed and commanding. Finding this new side of me was relieving because I could stand up for what I believed in with direction and will while also protecting my sensitive side. * I enjoy directing people. I found myself starting being capable of being firm and direct with people I'm in a group with in order for us to accomplish a goal. I'm still cheerful and upbeat but I can be fully capable of directing, giving instructions, etc.  A bit bossy at times.* I don't care if something works but if something is easy to use, and has a purpose for its use. I like to hear other people's opinions, gather the facts and make a conclusion from it. I dislike to debate unless I have the facts with me in order for me to use it to backup my point, without data points to reference, I feel aimless when talking about my opinions. * My feeling side comes to my play when there are people and a moral crisis involved. Obviously, I'm still an Fi user. I see the world through my inner emotions. I hold the people that I've internally let in very close to me. But on the outside even if I act bubbly and cheerful, I can also act very professional and business like. I'm good with self discipline, I may be spontaneous but I'm good at appearing detached and objective even when deep down my inner side represent a whole new world. * I'm a huge procrastinator and prefer to spontaneously improvise and figure out my shit from there, but when I do feel passionate for something then I like to use established methods to help my goals. I look up tutorials, figure out what advice people who are experienced tell me and then find a way that others have done the same thing successfully and essentially repeat their process. I think this has made me good in the things I've found passion in.* I struggle dealing with my softer side. I'm definitely an Fi user. I feel deeply over many things, some things just feel really 'wrong'.

750,ESFP,"Hi everyone! I'm Derek (ENTJ). My friends and I just recently launched an MBTI based dating app called Boo, but have gotten thousands of sign ups already. After much tweaking, we finally wanted to share this with you in the hopes that this may help you find like-minded friends and loved ones.We felt like current dating apps were really inefficient. They help you meet more people, not more of the right people. This means wasted time, money, and emotional preparation on bad dates with no chemistry. It's not just bad dates; the time and effort from swiping, messaging, arranging dates, and preparing both emotionally and physically, just for dates to continuously not work out, has led to dating fatigue and the sense that online dating is hopeless. It's also hard to tell what a person is actually like through text, only to be disappointed after meeting or the first month of dating.What we as MBTI enthusiasts have always known is that who we are (personality type) tends to influence the kinds of people we're attracted to, and it doesn't make sense for this not to play a part in mainstream online dating.We wanted to create a radically authentic, transparent, and empathetic dating experience where people can feel free to be themselves, because it is exactly by being yourself that the right person will come along and like and appreciate you for who you naturally are. On Boo, if someone matched with you, they‚Äôre already aware of your best and worst traits, and still decided they‚Äôd rather have you over any other type. On Boo, you‚Äôre already what each other are looking for.As an ESFP, you're the life of the party; there's never a dull moment with you. You also have great aesthetic tastes and people skills. But at your worst, you're not a great long term planner, tend to engage in risky behavior, and overengage in self-indulgement. You‚Äôll want someone who sees the world as you do and loves you for your best, but also understands and forgives you at your worst, and would have it no other way. Our app is completely free, and you can download onOur Website: [boo.dating](https://boo.dating/)Apple App Store: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boo-psychology-dating-app/id1498407272?ls=1](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boo-psychology-dating-app/id1498407272?ls=1)Google Play Store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=enterprises.dating.boo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=enterprises.dating.boo)We hope you like Boo, and please share any feedback for us, on here or at (email: support at boo.dating) we'd love to hear your thoughts on how we can improve the experience!",New MBTI Dating App called Boo!

756,ESFP,"Hi! I'm an ENTP and I'd really like to get to know the other types better, especially ESFPs. Lately though, I've been having a bit of trouble. Bit of background: I used to have severe depression/anxiety/PTSD issues, so my parents sent me to a residential program. Turns out, if you group a bunch of people with a wide variety of issues together, the environment gets pretty toxic. Who knew? Long story short, the two ESFPs there would antagonize me and some of my friends. One would make subtle(ish) underhanded remarks about being creeped out by my bisexuality and steal my belongings, then claim that I was lying. AND I shared a room with her, where she would walk around naked, but would make remarks whenever I tried to change my shirt (""Can you put those away? We're all straight here, so you can stop""). This situation is incredibly unfortunate, because those were the only confirmed ESFPs I've known in my life, which leads me to the possibility that maybe it wasn't them, it was me.I've always worked hard to see things from multiple points of view and be a good listener and friend. If I've ever had an issue with anyone, I've always been able to talk it through with them. But for some reason, whatever I did just didn't work with them. So I'm wondering if there's some form of communication that I'm lacking. I feel really guilty about it, and super worried that it might happen with someone else. It's been half a year since it happened, but I still can't get it out of my head.Of course, I might just be overthinking. They might just be plain old mean, or homophobic, or just going through a rough time. But either way, I don't want to make anyone feel angry or disgusted. Also, you all seem so fun, and I really admire your vitality and your wit. I'd also like to get to know you all!Any tips on communication? Your pet peeves?

I got out of a long term relationship recently and I'm realizing I don't think I ever want to be married. I'm not interested in being in a long term relationship either. Not because the relationship was dysfunctional or anything, it was normal, fairly healthy, no abuse and he treated me with respect etc. I'm finding I miss the movie watching, talking, physical things but not the actual relationship status.I guess when I think about it, it just makes me sad to think anyone is voluntarily spending any time on this planet being unhappy voluntarily, and it seems like there are SO many unhappy married people who stay because they made a commitment. I know there are happy ones too! But it seems like there are far less.And I think you should try honor that commitment, but  I guess to me, why make it in the first place if there's a chance you just won't love each other anymore at some point and you know you made a promise to stay and be unhappy? I think so many people are not prepared to love the different versions (depressed, anxious, sad, happy) of a person for hopefully, 50-60 years.

Here I am, 21 years old, afraid of vulnerability and sex is almost at the very top of my priorities / value system.

884,ESFP,"* My main concern in life is being girly and chic. I hate anything perceived as masculine, such as playing sports, watching competitive things, playing video games, wearing dark colors, listening to rap music, and other things. I like watching fashion vlogs, makeup tutorials, singing, dancing, shopping, taking selfies, and other things along those lines. My career goal is to become a visual merchandiser for a high-end designer brand like Chanel. * In school, I'm pretty lazy and don't care about my grades as long as I pass. I just want to do the bare minimum. I find cheating on exams fun, usually copy other people's work, have gotten truancy letters, and have failed a couple classes. Group members have had a problem with me for free-riding, but I always just dismiss them with a sassy reply. I'm uninterested in getting to know my classmates because as shallow as it sounds, I don't care to befriend anyone unless I find them girly and pretty because I want friends I share common interests with. * I come across bitchy and cold, partially because I barely speak or smile. I don't care about the haters at all and I'm known to have an attitude. I've sassed many customers at work and I'm quite blunt, so it's not rare for people to have an issue with me. In the first place, I barely work anyway because I just want free time to do things I enjoy.* My biggest fear is becoming fat and manly because those are things I really can't stand on other people. I have to be as girly and skinny as possible. I'm not interested in dating, but if I were to date, I'd want a guy to spoil me with gifts, treat me like I'm a queen, and do things my way. I have expensive taste and like the finer things in life. I think expensive designer items like Chanel, YSL, Celine, Prada, Louis Vuitton and more are so gorgeous and I aspire to collect many of these items to make people jealous. Also even though I don't drink, I think going to expensive, fancy restaurants with champagne and expensive red wine is classy and chic. One of my friend's mom has many designer items, loves fine dining, and lives an extravagant life. I wish she was my mom instead. I love the Kylie Jenner lifestyle, minus her body because she's plastic. I hate surgery. My ideal place to travel is anywhere people view as classy, chic, and girly like Paris.* My idol is Ariana Grande because she's so girly and successful, yet she's still a feminist who knows her worth and will put people in their place for disrespecting her. Even though I barely speak, I also really like attention and praise. If I'm feeling more extroverted, I sometimes will talk a lot but if the conversation isn't in my interest, I don't want to speak at all.* I hate having my picture taken because I have to know how I look at all times. I can't risk having a bad photo where I end up looking fat or manly or whatever because I have to look perfectly girly and pretty at all times. Some people accuse my voice of being fake because it's really high, but I'm not faking my voice.",Am I ESFP?

930,ESFP,"ISFP (F) here, and I‚Äôve just been confused about this guy I‚Äôve been talking to for a few months now. When we first met he seemed so all in and interested, we texted and talked constantly. Then one day a couple weeks later, he just made a complete 180 overnight.Within 12 hours his texts suddenly became short, indifferent, and dismissive, and he was the same in person too. I honestly don‚Äôt know what happened, and we never got around to talking about it due to circumstance and him avoiding me. We were still pretty new to each other so I kinda just let this happen and figured we weren‚Äôt right for each other, but then by chance we met somewhere at an event and he ended up kissing me out of the blue (there was some alcoholic influence).After this though, we talked, and he said he didn‚Äôt know what he wants but that he still wants to be friends. At this point I still wasn‚Äôt that emotionally invested so I said that was fine. I had already figured we wouldn‚Äôt work out so I was t really let down.Over the next few weeks though, he paid a lot of attention to me and showered me with a lot of care and I‚Äôll admit that what was just a little crush before turned into me actually liking him. I put it aside because I knew he didn‚Äôt feel the same though.At some point he again suddenly stopped talking to me and growing distant again. I felt that for myself the healthiest thing to do this time was to let it happen and not question it, because I didn‚Äôt want to be at the mercy of my feelings for him anymore, and he‚Äôs clearly truly unsure of what he wants.This was going fine, but he again did a complete 180 one day and had come back to showing me a lot of attention and concern. I‚Äôm just really confused and tired at this point. I‚Äôve heard ESFP‚Äôs can have a lot of thought buildup sometimes which causes this seemingly sudden but not so sudden decisions.. But is it really normal for an ESFP to have such wild changes of heart SO suddenly?For me all of these choices he makes are pretty major and not something I could flip my personality around within a 12 hour period about. I don‚Äôt honestly feel like I have been pushy or needy whatsoever because on the contrary lately I‚Äôve been really wary of potentially getting hurt, so I‚Äôve been giving everyone around me in my life a lot of space, including him.",Is indecisiveness a common ESFP trait?

934,ESFP,"I know I can just ask him, but I kind of want to guess because I feel like it helps me learn more about the Myers Briggs and the various functions. I have a new friend who feels like either an ENFP or ESFP. I myself am an ENFP and at first I thought he was an ENFP too because we'll sometimes say the same thing at the same time and that often happens with other ENFPs. But recently we've been hanging out more and I've noticed that physical things seem to come naturally to him (like we went bowling and he just had this very natural form and we met climbing). It didn't initially occur to me that he would be an ESFP because the ones that I know are noticeably better at sports/physical things, but maybe that's just not his thing? He's doing a master's in flute performance, which would be hard to imagine my N self doing. Also, last night we were talking about how we visualize counting sheep and I said I just saw some generic white fence in the middle of nowhere and generic cartoon sheep jumping over it in a rainbow arc. But he said that he saw the details of that fence and the dirt under the fence where it's a little messed up because of when you open the gate and he saw real sheep, not cartoon sheep (he grew up near a lot of farms).

953,ESFP,"I am an INFJ and I was dating an ESFP for three months. Ninety percent of our relationship was fun, positive and enjoyable although we had some differences in our communication styles -- for example when we'd text, I could text him a huge paragraph conveying all my feelings, details about my day, etc., and he might respond with ""cool!"" A couple weeks ago, we had an argument over text about this communication difference (it took him several hours to respond to something important and it was really brief). After a brief heated exchange he immediately said via text ""maybe we are just better off as friends."" I was shocked that he would throw in the towel so quickly after one sign of conflict, when literally the day before we'd been cuddling on his couch talking about how much we liked each other. The next day I asked to meet up in person and after five minutes of talking we ""got back together."" I was again shocked at how quickly he could go from ""let's be friends"" to ""let's date again."" For me, I would never end something until I've given it a lot of careful thought. Fast forward two weeks and we were doing great, at least from my perspective. Hanging out every day he asked me to be his valentine, meet his family, book a trip together. He'd say things like ""I really really like you."" He purchased a bed for my dog at his house. He purchased puzzles on Amazon for us to work on while we watched TV together. Then, he had a  meeting with his therapist and they talked about our relationship in depth. Apparently the therapist told him that our communication differences would never work. My boyfriend called me after the meeting and told me that he had to cancel our plans that evening (about 20 minutes before I was supposed to meet him, no explanation except he'd ""had a day""). I tried to reach out that night to find out if he was OK and he responded hours later with just ""I'm OK thanks."" The next day, I hear nothing. I finally reach out and ask if everything is OK between us and he finally tells me that he's questioning the relationship. We go back and forth, and he seems to be really undecided about it still saying several times ""I'm a mess and all over the place."" When I try to talk some more he says ""please please stop I can't talk about this right now."" I give him space and assume we can talk more when he's feeling better. Instead, he texts the next day and says ""I think we should break up for right now."" Here are my questions: Literally the day before all this happened, he did a lot of things like asking me to be his valentine, talking about going on trips together, etc. that indicated to me he was investing in me. Then, he does a 180 literally in one day. Is this an ESFP thing? Going back and forth? Also, he seems to really avoid the difficult conversations. He'd rather say ""My brain is all over the place"" or end things than to have a difficult conversation about an issue we're having. It's like he'd rather run away from the problem than face it head on. Is this also an ESFP thing? Just would like to understand this type better to get a better sense of what was going through his brain.",Is it normal for ESFPs to be indecisive and run away from their issues?

965,ESFP,"I'm an ISFJ, He's an ESFPWe'd been dating for 2 weeks and since day 1 he's been asking me to go to his house and have some ""fun"". As an ISFJ, I want to first fully trust in an relationship before sex because sex just makes me more emotionally attached to the person and I don't want to risk doing that early in a relationship.He tried to confront me about this and said a man needs to have his sexual desires met so they know that their feelings are valued and asked me for the reason of not going to his house. I said I want my boyfriend to make me feel loved, I want to see him putting an effort for me. He asked for examples and I said I want my boyfriend to take me on dates, buy me things and in general spoil me (I had a very hard time articulating these but I thought it'd actually help him understand things clearly and our relationship will actually be strengthened)We'd been dating for 2 weeks and he had only taken me on 2 dates. Apart from those I'd just meet him in his car and he'd do a lot of touch/kiss with me which I absolutely enjoyed them cause I loved him. After I told him those he was like ok no problem but became distant and dropped me off near my house without a kiss (I even asked if something was wrong and he said no)Note that we come from a country where gender roles pretty much still apply in here. 30 minutes later he sent me this text message: ""we are not compatible with each other, I wish you had told me all that earlier so I wouldn't continue with you. You should look for a sugar daddy instead""As an ISFJ I just want to be appreciated and my top love language according to the 5 love languages theory is gift giving (being spoiled in general)I don't date to use people and actually on behalf of ISFJs I can say that a little effort will satisfy us a lot. I just see these efforts as a sign that my bf loves me and it helps me with my trust issues. I've been crying these past few dates. He actually ended things in a way that it's all my fault and I actually fell for it. No matter how hard I try not to blame myself but ISFJs are very past oriented I keep saying that if I hadn't said it that way, if I hadn't brought it up, if I had just waited for him to realize that himself, he'd still be here.

She's come over a couple times to chill, and as a fairly laid back guy I'm more than happy to sit with a coffee and chat abstractly; in fact I love just listening to her reflect on shit, her outlook is super uplifting. We've had a couple of nice kisses and I'm upping my affection every time I see her (no need to rush as this is looking to be a real wifey.) I am starting to think I might be too relaxed and not exciting enough, as it doesn't come naturally to me to do crazy spontaneous shit; I don't want her to get bored.

973,ESFP,"Hi.. INFP here.I've joined the subs of various types to get over my pre-concieved biases and judgements... offcourse it's a lot harder than it sounds... especially since I'm doing this only online.My preconceived judgements are going to be... pretty much offensive. I'm very sure they are ment to be that way by design considering they mostly come from anxieties. So if you are offended and feel like getting aggressive about it.. I am totally okay with that. I won't hold it against anyone.Anyways.. to the point. My conceptualisation of ESFPs is one of The Hedonist. And I don't mean Greek Philosophy.I'm talking about someone with no or min values with complete priorities serving the material experience of desires. If you have seen the movie Spring Breakers, you can have an idea of what I mean here. Okay. You may now feel free to correct me.",Tell me about ESFPs
974,ESFP,"I wrote up a list of what I believe makes me an ESFP. Let me know if you relate to or disagree with any of the below!1. Non JudgementalESFPs prefer to see the good in everyone. They are open minded and quite comfortable with accepting other‚Äôs differences, even if they don‚Äôt personally agree with them, as long as they don‚Äôt severely clash with the ESFP‚Äôs personal values. The worst thing to an ESFP is when someone tries to impose their values onto them. 2. Social ChameleonESFPs have a talent for being able to get along with different types of people by reading a room and matching its energy. Whether it‚Äôs a party or a book club, ESFPs can change their energy/demeanor to one that fits appropriately to the setting.3. Small Inner CircleEven though they may have a large number of friends and acquaintances, ESFPs tend to only have a few select people they can trust and feel comfortable enough to share their most private inner thoughts and feelings. 4. Alone Time to RechargeESFPs love people and social settings, but need time alone to process their feelings and the events of the day. ESFPs need quiet time to self-reflect on their values and review/refine them to make sure they align correctly with who they are.5. Gut FeelingAn ESFP has no problem trusting their gut when making a decision, because their gut feeling is heavily tied with their moral code and values. If their gut says yes, to an ESFP, there is no doubt.6. FOMO: Fear of Missing OutThe thought of missing out on something fun is almost painful for an ESFP. With every occasion comes the possibility of something awesome happening, and they don‚Äôt want to risk not being there for it.7. Seeing Both SidesESFPs can have trouble making a decision or choosing a side when they are able to see the validity in both arguments. This can turn into an unhealthy form of analysis paralysis, and frustrate others as they perceive the ESFP as wishy washy.8. Likes People, but Not EveryoneOthers may see the ESFP as a people pleaser who likes everyone, but this is only partly true. Yes, the ESFP naturally enjoy making others happy and are accepting of others‚Äô differences, but they will not waste a single breath on those who offend or breach their personal values.9. Sensitive to RejectionESFPs are sensitive to criticism from others, especially from those who they have no problem with, and will take it personally. They‚Äôll often become stuck in their heads mulling over what they might have done wrong  for others to not like them, and find it hard to accept that not everyone will like you no matter how hard you try.10. Communicates LiterallyESFPs will say exactly what they mean and not beat around the bush. They can be frustrated when others take a long time to get to the point, are passive aggressive, or use cryptic wording that requires reading between the lines. 11. Attuned to Other‚Äôs EmotionsESFPs have a natural knack for noticing sudden changes in facial expressions and are sensitive to others‚Äô feelings. This skill is useful for when the ESFP is engaging others and reading the room. This may however become an issue when the ESFP‚Äôs intuition is actually incorrect, which can lead to misunderstanding and misreading the situation.12. Great in CrisisESFPs are surprisingly good at staying calm and efficient under crisis. It‚Äôs as if they enter a hyper focus mode where nothing else matters except finding the most efficient solution possible.13. Trouble Putting Emotions into WordsAlthough the ESFP can experience strong emotions and often make feelings-based decisions, they can have trouble putting these emotions into words. They can often recognize what they‚Äôre feeling but may need time to process why they‚Äôre feeling that way.14. Picture Perfect Memory (Selective)ESFPs can be scatterbrained and forgetful at times, but have the ability to recall and visualize important memories with incredibly detailed accuracy. They will remember the sights, sounds, and smells that took place in that moment. It‚Äôs hard for an ESFP to remember names, but they will never forget a face.15. Hates InauthenticityESFPs are commonly judged as fake because of their natural openness towards others and positivity. People may be turned off by someone who seems happy all the time, not realizing that ESFPs also experience negative feelings, they are just more private about them. In reality, ESFPs hate inauthenticity and are incapable of pretending to like someone they cannot stand, even if they were paid to do so. Acting in a way that is not their natural selves will trigger the gag reflex in an ESFP.",15 Things ESFPs Do

I'm trying really hard to help her, but honestly, many people are having a problem communicating with her and are getting frustrated with her lack of organization and always looking to others for (group think) instead of having a vision and not feeling like a leader. I think she's also losing respect for seeming to be more about leading through her social game. I'm not out to get her, but she is obviously using my name to blame for things she isn't doing. The way you can tell this isn't true is that she doesn't come back and bring me in her office to tell me how I underperformed. I hear through other people what she is saying. The fact that she doesn't tell me, shows that she knows it isn't true. I'm just a scapegoat. That said, I'm not trying to go to war with her. I'm not trying to sabotage her.

If there is a way forward, let me know how you might see that possibility. I would rather not have to go into self defense mode, as there is always a chance self defense mode can turn into self destruction mode, or at least, mutual self destruction.

Also, he never appears to outwardly care too much if plans change, if I can no longer hang out, etc. This is a great quality on the one hand, the issue is that often it comes across like he just doesn't care that much.

Hoping for advice from some other ESFPs who might understand firsthand.1. Talking about ""abstract ideas"" and such. I love talking about the meaning of something, why people do things the way that they do, basically anything involving the ""why"" of things. Sometimes it feels like talking to a brick wall. For example, we were watching a television show last night I said ""wow there are a lot of underlying political statements being made in this show"" hoping to start a conversation about the topic and get into a little bit of depth. Instead, his response was ""Hmmm"" and then he proceeded to make a goofy comment about the outfit that a character was wearing. Other times, he won't really respond until like five minutes later. So that makes me think maybe it takes him awhile to process? I just don't know how the ESFP brain works. My question here -- is there any way to coax more depth from him in these kinds of moments? As an INFJ I need a bit of this to feel like my soul is being satisfied. I love the goofy comments and such too, but I need the serious discussions as well. 2. The value he places in social approval. For example, his friends were over yesterday and the discussion got a bit misogynistic at least in my book. He does not think that way himself (I know this for certain) but rather than lead the group to a different discussion topic, he let it happen without saying anything. It's hard for me to understand this. If my friends were making racist comments or something for example, I would at least say *something* to shut the conversation down. In other situations -- when we have big groups of people, he tends to leave me to ""fend for myself"" and seems more concerned with fitting in with the group himself. It just seems that being in the ""in crowd"" is really important to him and he is not one to stand up for his values the way that I am. I would be interested to hear an ESFP's perspective on this. Why is ""following the crowd"" so important? It is just hard for me to understand as an INFJ where I will literally isolate myself from society if I don't agree with it and I give zero fucks what ""cool"" people think.",INJF - ESFP relationship -- can it work?

1015,ESFP,"I‚Äôve had a crush on an ESFP who went to my undergrad for the past 8 years since I graduated. Back when we were students, he was a year below and pursued me first, but then I immediately graduated and that was the end of it. He‚Äôs so sweet and energetic I thought he was gay at first. Silly me. He‚Äôs just a thoughtful, sensitive guy with the widest smile and tons of positive energy.  Very popular and ambitious and always on the go. We recently ended up in the same town for work stuff and saw each other for the first time since college and there were freakin‚Äô fireworks. He asked me to meet up and get dinner together, so he found a place  to eat after the one I suggested ended up being close. We were vibing and he invited me to his place, and we ended up chilling/making out/sleeping together. Def not something I do regularly, but I was feeling it since he‚Äôs such a gentleman and asked me deep, thoughtful questions and tried to make sure I was comfortable and complimented me with the sweetest words I‚Äôd ever heard a man say.  It was like out of a movie and I was putty in his hands, but he was putty in mine too so it worked out nicely. He paid for me to Uber home (had to peace onto quickly to catch a flight home and he seemed sad) and has been messaging me ever since. I‚Äôm not moving to his city for six months or so, but he seems to want to stay in touch. He travels for leisure and his job all but a few days out of the  month, so not sure what potential is there for a relationship. Since ESFPs are here and now kind of people‚Äîlike us ENFPs‚ÄîI‚Äôm wondering what you guys think of him in terms of how he‚Äôs acting based on how you‚Äôve acted with those you‚Äôve made a connection with. I don‚Äôt know what I want yet, but he‚Äôs pretty cool and it‚Äôd be good to see him again. You ESFPs have that combo of idealism and being action-oriented which is super attractive to those of us who overthink everything. Feeling optimistic but not obsessive. It‚Äôs a peaceful feeling that comes from how proactive he‚Äôs been, and being considerably older and wiser than when we first met. I feel like we‚Äôre evenly matched in terms of social skills and how busy we both are which is refreshing because it doesn‚Äôt feel that way with NTs.

Basically, I have no idea how to become close with an ESFP. They always seem to bounce around a lot, make friends with a lot of people, but then it feels like I‚Äôm forgotten.

1042,ESFP," (TL;DR: Question for the ESFPs. How do you deal with possible situations which would be bad at a specific time like an unwanted pregnancy?)That was the short version, now in-depth:I'm (32, ENFP-A, type 2 closely followed by 7) in a polyamorous relationship with my husband (36, INFP-T, type 4) and my boyfriend (25, ESFP-A, type 7). They are not romantically involved with each other, but are good friends. My husband and I live together. And there are shared visions of all of us living together.Hubby and I are somewhat ready for a child but we're not actively trying, since we have a lot going on in our lives, well especially he. We've been together for 14 years now and have a very happy relationship. He and I are very typically xNxP types as we're often in our heads, think through patterns, future-oriented emotional thinkers.BF and I have been together for only about 6 months now. We're extremely happy and we're both in for the long run. I can't believe the luck I've had to find two soulmates like this... but anyways, BF is very typically ESFP. Very much lives in the moment, happy-go-lucky, if something isn't a problem right now - don't waste worry on it kinda guy. I love this about him, even 'though it can lead to neglecting plans that might be important for his life and organising his time is quite a task for him. He is 7 years younger than I and is in the middle of his studies at university and doesn't yet know what he'll do later and if he ever even wants kids of his own.Now, I'm not really asking for advice, since my situation isn't real yet, but it made me think how ESFPs generally react to stuff like that. I'm about to get my period, I hope, but for some reason a part of me is afraid of being pregnant. There was some light nausea and unusual cramping which confused me, but I'm probably not pregnant. It would be my boyfriends for sure. (We did use a condom, but you know..)If the universe would only revolve around me I'd be okay with it. I told him quite early in the relationship that if an accident should ever happen and I was to  get pregnant, I wouldn't have an abortion, I'm just not at the age and life stage anymore where I'd want to. He knows that. And we talked about it a couple times. Husband also knows that and is okay with it.But the universe does not revolve around me and I think  pregnancy right now would be a really really really shitty thing for both my men at the moment. So, that's why I really hope I'm not pregnant - it can wait, I'm in no hurry.But it's interesting to think about it: My husband would flip, I mean he'd be so overwhelmed and directly dive into a spiral of ""ohmygods"", because it would mean a lot of changes in our lives and it wasn't part of his future plans...And with my bf: Even 'though I think it would be the worst for him (young, still studying, doesn't know if he wants kids ever) I think he'd be the one handling it the best, because of his one day after another approach on life.That's where I come back to my question: Do ESFPs generally handle situations like this well or are they either go with the flow or flee the scene types?I'm interested in your answers, thx for reading that whole wall for those who have ;)",How do ESFPs handle stressful news like an unwanted pregnancy?

If I'm an ESFP, I ain't proud of it.* Chatting is fun (E)* I'm drawn to non-fiction; and all my future planning is done and out of the way (S)* I value values over logic (F)* I'm quite spontaneous, too (P)And I am, and always have been, the one temperamental drama queen who throws temper tantrums and evacuates everybody a zillion miles away. Obviously, you peeps can't judge my type because you probs don't know me, but I'm just sharing my thoughts and I'm worried that I might be an ESFP.The reason I would sometimes class myself as an INTP is because I do enjoy solitude, theories, logic and spontaneity. Everyone has an idiosyncratic balance of extraversion and introversion; sensing and intuition; thinking and feeling; judging and perceiving; but our dominant preferences are what defines our types. I'm just scared, I might be an ESFP trying to be an INTP :(",MIGHT BE THE E-WORD (entertainer)

1071,ESFP,"Hi. My ex is an ESFP and I'm an ISFP. 2 weeks ago, he sat me down and spoke to me about how he feels the relationship had gone stagnant. Before we got together, we shared alot about our past relationships and i know the scars he has had from previous relationships. During the relationship, we both had our guard up because of our history in other relationships. When he sat me down for that conversation, I think i had my guard up and started analysing how because of what happened, maybe he couldnt open his heart up or he is afraid of repeating mistakes. I have been very nice to him and he couldnt stress that enough. We decided to take a break and he cried when i left and said sorry. i have been a big part of his life. i was calm through the conversation. Over the week, my mind went crazy and i started analysing myself and texting him alot. I think i was also having PMS. he said i kept going back and forth with what i want and that he feels i turn myself into what i think he wants and its not what he asked for. He asked me to think about who i am and what i want. i think due to my crazinesss, he made a decsion to end things. I have asked for a conversation but he asked me to do it over a phonecall. my last text to him was to apologise for how intense the last week was and its cool we chill for awhile. My friends have found him back on Tinder.At this point, i feel that he has made me aware of what went on and that I needed to fix myself. I still feel i would like to have a conversation with him to apologise for the further damage i have done to him by using his history against him. I would like to do so after I have fixed myself and not feel like i want him back anymore. I guesss my question is, how long should i take for him to be less angry about everything that has been said. I would sill like to have him in my life because he has been positive for me and ive supported him through therapy. How should i approach him. I have been reading abt his personality type and understanding that i shouldnt talk more about the past. What is a good way to apologise to an ESFP and how long later.

1102,ESFP," I know what my ""possible"" type might be but I would rather you type me not knowing anything due to bias.¬†I'm 21 years old and a female. I have always felt very different from others, misunderstood, underappreciated and in some cases walked over. (used to happen a lot as a child)I'm empathetic, I care a lot about the underprivileged and about world issues although I know there isnt much I can do due to the established systems. I usually manage to chose who to empathize with, I think more in terms of sympathy rather than empathy. I always give money to the homeless.¬†I can express my feelings in text, not in person. When I write I dont write very literally when it comes to my feelings, but rather metaphorically. Sometimes I just dont understand my feelings or why I feel the way I do, am I overreacting to things? I cant make sense of my feelings, which is why I usually seek outside perspective, asking people about if my reactions are sensitive- usually it is in terms of anger and frustration when I talk about feelings.¬†I am very talkative when I want to talk about something I really enjoy, science, philosophy, politics, anything that you think about- that makes you theorize. I love theories and I love philosophy. Although I am talkative, I can be extremely quit and shy. I seek humans sometimes for connection when I feel too lonely, the only person¬† I have is my boyfriend. I love meeting new people but I can get bored very very easily if the person is extremely predictable- I dont like predictable people but at the same time if I cant predict them I get too stressed. I need to know their motives and how they function and how they react in certain situations, which is why I sometimes ""test"" people.¬†I enjoy debating, seeing things from other perspectives and understanding WHY people think the way they do and what makes them think the way they do, which is why I have a fascination with national socialism, why would anyone adapt such an illogical ideology when it doesnt make any sense, from a scientific viewpoint? If it did then I would understand. I have a hard time accepting peoples views if they dont make sense, unfortunately, and I tend to get angry and emotional when someone elses argument doesnt make any logical sense- and if it is only based on their opinion and understanding of the world- I need theories that are based on facts, on some reliable foundation.¬†I love reading, I have a vivid imagination and I talk to myself way too much. I enjoy theatre I would think and I like poetry. I just like to write down my thoughts and ideas, feelings and such since I just cant express them in normal form.¬†I am very very kind, sometimes too kind, especially to strangers. I treat everyone the same- thats not even a rule I have, it just happens naturally.¬†I can be selfish at times, quite a lot actually. Just more of a ""me"" attitude at times, probably because of my parents spoiling me. I grew up in a fairly religion family but as long as I can remember I've always, compared to my siblings, been the one questioning God. I am in my first relationship right now, and it is not going very well. My partner is insensitive, whenever there is an issue I want to resolve it immediately, since I'm very direct. I don't want to move on or talk about it later, I want to talk about it now, why should I leave a problem unsolved? I hate uncertainty more than anything, I need to know that we are good so I can be ready to settle down and plan for my future.¬†I feel like a walking alien, living a life I have not chosen to live but am thankful for, trying to find my purpose in life every day, my passion, what I want to do forever. But since my Interests are wide I can't. I've always been the weird kid in school, the oddball but never really bullied- strangely so. I just have never felt in place in this world, and it feels like no one thinks the way I do. Everyone says that I think in a different way. I'm lazy but with ambition, I have potential to do lots of things and I am very optimistic about everything. I always wonder about things. So, I apologise for the long text, what time would you say I am, according to what I have written?¬†(I failed to mention that I have been diagnosed with anxiety and atypical autism- which is, having traits related to some autistic traits at age 13, just in case that might help in typing me)",Am I an ESFP?

1122,ESFP,"Growing up;Mom - ENFJ - super sweet, so so naive!!  We fought a TON during my teen years. She never understood my freedom needs and my impulsivity. She tries to ‚Äúfix‚Äù everything but we are very close now. Dad - ISTP - Fierce temper, but we got along amazing!!  I felt like I was his clone and until we did personality tests, I was sure we could‚Äôve been the same type. His typing couldn‚Äôt have been more accurate though. He also saved lives for a living, so made sense. He taught me how to be super handy and helps me with projects all of the time. Older sibling - ISFP - Never have fought more with anyone like I did and still do with this sibling. We can‚Äôt seem to really trust or fully enjoy each otherOlder sibling - INTJ - Super easy to get along with and I would say we were and are as close as you can be with an INTJYounger sibling - ISFP. As kids, we were very close and even closer as adults. We do struggle a lot with communication as he thinks I sap his energy. He says he can‚Äôt converse as quickly as I do and so with this info, it‚Äôs helped my communication with the older ISFP. Now with my own familyMe- ESFP - obviously the coolest typeHusband- ENTP - I find him fascinating and also incredibly boring. üòÇWe do things very differently but we have had a pretty awesome marriage. Child- INFPChild- INFJGrowing up we pretty well understood each other. I of course was so frustrated with being the ESFP because NO ONE TALKED in my family. Haha. So I was definitely the annoying one but we had some crazy shenanigans in this home with all of the sensors and the INTJ was probably the second most ballsy next to my ISTP dad. It was a wild and fun household. With the family I created, man alive I struggle sometimes as the only sensor!!  Everyone in my house is pretty cautious and stuck in their heads all of the time. The kids especially, yikes, so so sensitive!  üòÇ. It makes it very challenging for me to understand them and to curb my insensitivity sometimes. Also, any other ESFP‚Äôs stay at home parents??  I‚Äôve been one for 14 years now and it feels like a prison sometimes. If I could choose again, I wouldn‚Äôt be a SAHP but this is the life I chose and so I choose to enjoy it to the best of my abilities. The same routines and seeing the same walls all day every day is torture sometimes. Share what your family dynamics are like!

1130,ESFP,"So a few months ago i contacted a female coworker (late 20's like myself) through social media, and we briefly conversed for a week or so.. related in deep ways..anyways, I ended up asking her to hang out outside of work.. and she said she's busy with her two jobs, so we agreed to talk on lunch break, and it went well!two days later or so, I followed up and asked if she wanted to get coffee outside of work, WHEN it's a better time for her.. and no reply.. she then slowly backed away. next day at work (retail, different departments we work in), she thought I would be dramatic or act different, but I was very casual and respectful like nothing happened at all. I've been this way ever since, so about 5 weeks..anyways, lately at work she will go out of her way to talk to me... like at the end of the night, i'll still be closing up my department, and she'll be on her way out.. she'll walk by and say ""bye (my name)!"", or say ""night (my name)!"", both with a smile.Why would she go out of her way to say these things, when she blatantly ignores me for weeks on end on facebook?",ESFP ignoring INFP...

1148,ESFP,"Hiya, I'm a ISFP/ESFP mix. Could you help type me? (I'm mildly autistic so I may not seem very feeler like)I'm not all that introverted. I've always enjoyed socialising but I lose energy quickly and randomly which is pretty annoying. It doesnt follow a pattern either, so I could be out and I would suddenly fall very tired. Other times I can keep going for ages and really enjoy myself! I have pretty bad social anxiety which stops me from making friends, seeing friends, going out quite a lot. But without that, I know I would like making friends and just having a great time with them.I'm definitely a feeler, but I lack empathy and quite a lot of emotion sometimes due to some weird emotional detachment I have which I've never been able to understand. I place more value on my heart than my head, and I've always loved making relationships. However, I'm not particularly loving, and I get angry when someone becomes too emotional or overreacts, like my dad does ü§¨ I also hate conflict, and I do remember lots of times when my parents or my friends would argue and I would just have to run away with a face full of tears üò∂ I still do that.

I wanna understand how ESFPs are like from an ESFP perspective so that i can understand what my true type is. Information about me.- i am very scatterbrained. My teachers have always said i have a wide range of information but my issue is i simply dont have structure and cant settle down. - i have lots of different interests and ideas. I usually pick up an interest, think imma be a master at it then drop it coz i was lazy or something. - i am an optimist but i think im pretty realistic person. - my housemaid used to say ""Layton your problem is, you only know how to use your brain in class"". I have crap practical skills and basically freeload my way through life and school. ( im only 18)- i like football, anime, videogames but have a wide range of interests including philosophy, economics, politics, etc. - i love ideas that seem so spiritual and unseen. ( have interests in things like law of attraction, astrology, etc)- i do physical activity for fun and to look after my health. Used to be a couch potato but i grew more responsible for myself as i grew older and begun taking more care about myself. - i have had my friends take this test, 3 of them got INTJ, one got ENTJ, others are ENTP, ISFP, ISFJ. - i crush very easily. Learnt to control it better- when i play music, it triggers my imagination and i can run around my room for 2 hours in my imaginary world looking like a retard. - im lazy asf. - i hate partying coz i think its a waste of time. - keeping a routine is so fkin difficult omegalul. - have short ass attention span.

1162,ESFP,"[MBTI was inconclusive between a few types](https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/co7jp8/please_type_me_im_so_confused/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) so I'm trying to find input to see which one fits better :-)**1) What do you yearn for in life? Why?**I really just want to have the freedom to live the way I want. If I want to sit on the computer and look at memes until 3am then I'm free to do so, if I want to eat out and eat junk food then I'm free to do so, etc. Large commitment like marriage and having kids and stuff like that makes me extremely uncomfortable and even a bit pissed thinking about it because you can't do anything or hang out with your friends because you're constantly cleaning and fighting and changing diapers etc. I want to be able to get involved in activites and community revolving around my interests and I'll end up skating around anything and everything that prevents me from doing that**2) Think about a time where you felt like you were at your finest. Tell us what made you feel that way.**I felt on top of the world when everything seems to be going right, all my favorite online communities are alive, my grades are fine, I'm on my parents' good side and we go out a lot, nobody is 'on my case' and trying to monitor everything I do, my friends invite me out, and I have events to look forward in the coming days. I feel happy when it's like that because I can enjoy myself and not have to worry about anything and have something to look forward to as well. It's a really happy feeling.**3) What makes you feel inferior?**When I try to speak up in a group of people and they all just stare at me stoicly and show this contempt that gives off this ""f you"" vibe. This happens especially with random adults that I try to talk to since I'm young. Or when I say something or do something and someone yells a varient of ""who do you think you are"" or ""who do you think you're talking to"" that makes me feel very small too. **4) What tends to weigh on your decisions? (Do you think about people, pro-cons, how you feel about it, etc.)**It depends.. if I'm choosing a short term thing like maybe an area to hang out at, I would probably base it off of ""hey the vending machine actually works there"" or ""yeah that other place has a lot of mesquitos"" or ""they have faster wifi"" etc. But if it's a long term thing like a college, I'd choose based on what they have available, what kind of people I would make friends with there, how close it is to the city, and am I going to be able to do the things I love there etc. **5) When working on a project what is normally your emphasis? Do you like to have control of the outcome?**If it's a school project 99% of the time I'm not even going to want to do it lol. So I'd probably procrastinate a lot and then when I finally start doing it I'll put a lot of emphasis on what's required of me and the specific instructions and what I need to do to not fail and get that done as fast as possible and then if I'm actually remotely interested in it I'll go back and add more quality. If it's a group project, I just sit my booty on my phone until someone tells me what I need to do to contribute and help out and I'll do that and then be done lol. **6) Describe us a time where you had a lot of fun. How is your memory of it?**I went to a large dinner with like 30+ people and I had some margaritas and took a lot of pictures, ordered a ton of desserts, told stories and laughed a lot and those 5-6 hours only felt like a few minutes to me because one funny/cool thing after another kept happening and it was like a non-stop stream of awesomeness and I never wanted to leave. I still remember it very well since it was an extremely significant event in my life. It changed my perspective a lot, it gave me a lot of faith in humanity and showed me that holy crap I didn't know people could be this nice and fun.**7) When you want to learn something new, what feels more natural for you? (Are you more prone to be hands on, to theorize, to memorize, etc)**It really depends what I'm learning. If im learning how to cook a meal I remember it better if I watch someone do it in front of me or do it myself. But if I'm learning something like the world maps, I tend to link the country names to something important to me (my friend was from X so now I'll never forget where it is on the map). If im learning how to use a new software then I'll start trying to find the basic features (how do I save? how do I set my profile picture? can I see my friends list?) and then familiarize myself like that. It reaaaaally depends though and I don't learn everything exclusively with one style**9) How organized do you to think of yourself as?**I only organize the things that matter to me I've noticed. Like, my locker can look like a landfill and my clothing drawer has no system to it whatsoever, but I also have folders and discord servers and photo albums that I've spend hours designing and making it organized so I can find everything in 1 second and it looks satisfying. But I can only find the energy to do that if its especially personally relevant. Everything else is a tornado**10) How do you judge new ideas? You try to understand the principles behind it to see if they make sense or do you look for information that supports it?**I think I tend to figure out how it works first?  like for MBTI I went straight to ok what do these letters stand for, what do they indicate, how do you decode the letters into a cognitive function stack, what do the cognitive functions stands for, how does this add up with me, etc. I really have no idea (I spent like 45 minutes on this question lol üòÇ)**11) You find harmony by making sure everyone is doing fine and belonging to a given group or by making sure that you follow what you believe and being yourself?**I think I definitely feel more at peace with the latter, I don't think I really pay attention to if everyone in the group is feeling fine and even if I did notice I wouldn't have the slightest idea what to do :/. On the other hand I feel very at ease when I'm allowed to express my excitement about an interest or a value and if I'm being critised or pushed down for it I consider that to be 0% harmony**12) Are you the kind that thinks before speaking or do you speak before thinking? Do you prefer one-on-one communication or group discussions?**I'm absolutely a speak-before-think person. To this day I still get dirty looks after blurting something out and regret it. It's a big issue since my childhood and I barely think things through and I've gotten screwed over many times. As for discussions I find groups to be a ton more fun, I feel like I'm not wasting my time when I speak (((assuming they're listening, and assuming the group didn't just break up and start a bunch of one-on-one micro convos))). And when my mind goes blank, I can rely on other people to prevent the awkward silence, and generally I feel more excited to speak up. Whereas one-on-one can be beneficial depending on the topic or if it's really personal or something, I just think it would be kind of stale if I had the choice between that or the group.**13) Do you jump into action right away or do you like to know where are you jumping before leaping? Does action speaks more than words?**This was a tough one for me and I actually had to ask a good friend who knew me very well about this lol. They said I'm definitely more of a leap first person and I don't do much thinking but this could very well just be my age. I'm p young. Also I think words can have a lot of meaning, I know that when I screw up I write apology essays and I know if someone writes one for me, I'll definitely acknowledge it and be touched by it. Actions are important too, I try to make sure I don't contradict my words but when I do and then the other person loses trust in me I dont blame them. They both have weight but just for different purposes. **14) It's Saturday. You're at home, and your favourite show is about to start. Your friends call you for a night out. What will you do?**This actually happened to me the other week lol!!! I was about to binge watch the office with a bowl of cheese balls when my friend called and wanted to go shopping. I was extremely hyped and jumped right out my chair to go meet them. There's no way I'm turning down an invitation to go out. Netflix is always there for me later**15) How do you act when you're stressed out?**When something bad is *actively* happening, for example my parents going through my web history or going through my room, during that kind of stress, my stomach physically feels sick and I really just start shutting down yet feel jerked awake at the same time. I can't do anything so I just stand there, actually physically shaking, feeling helpless because there's nothing I can do, and I start thinking bad things like ""Did I forget to clean my history?? They are going to find my X account, and then they're gonna dig around in my email and force the password out of me and go on a tangent and then find everything I've worked for and take it away from me and I'm not going to have a phone or Internet connection ever again and I have to buy a computer in secret somehow and run away and I'll be living life against my own family just to get my crap back"" and just go down that rabbit hole and start thinking what can I do to get out and if I can't get out I'll feel hopelessly trapped. All this turmoil and on the outside I'm simply unmoving, sweating, and have a straight face**16) What makes you dislike the personalities of some people?**I really really hate it when people are aloof and judgemental and indifferent especially when I'm being really excited about something or just simply trying to talk to them. I've met people who give off the impression of a snobby cult leader, and every word just seems to be going up their ass and it's a waste of time to talk to them. It's the kind of vibe that would make you feel like saying ""F*** YOU TOO"" even if they didn't say anything. Their body language and responses say it well enough. So stoic and stand offish.**17) Is there anything you really like talking about with other people?**I looooooooove talking about funny stories with people. Like I'll tell them about the time I sprayed some random crap and ruined the wall as a child and they'd tell me about another story about their experience or what they did as a child too. Just laughing at situations that weren't funny at the time haha. I also like talking about things that I'm interested in, like cats and what my cat does and what theirs does etc. If Im lucky I'll find someone who heard about MBTI but they're rare and they usually don't even remember their letters **18) What kind of things do you pay the least attention to in your life?**I don't pay attention to how I'm pervievd by others. This applies in a lot of ways. I don't care about my appearance, if I want to wear a T shirt and jeans they are comfortable for me and I don't care if I'm looking formal or impressing anyone. Of course I take care of my hygiene and don't want to smell bad but honestly I'm not a big fasionita either. I also shout blunt stuff sometimes like if someone hands me their business card I was like ""OH this is the company that screwed me over!!"" and then they're kind of offended. Also little things like dropping the entire spoon into the soup bowl and not noticing that the next person has to dig it out etc. I'm kind of a jack ass like that but I'm working on it**19) How do your friends perceive you? What is wrong about their perception? What would your friends never say about your personality?**A couple of my friends have said that I was very quiet at first, but then I started being talkative later. I think I was quiet mostly because my parents were closely watching and I was scared to get in trouble or say something that would get me screwed, or because I was face-in-phone and really absorbed in what I'm doing. Another group of friends see me as very vulgar because when there's absolutely no boundaries I start making really dirty jokes lol. One of my friends commented that I see the beauty in everything. Another friend sees me as polite and give more than I take. And my parents see me as outgoing, aware of my surroundings to an extent, and sometimes inappropriate and imposing and interrupt a lot. Somebody called me a lazy sloth too lol. It seems like the different people have different perceptions. But they all never seem to describe me as thoughtful or reserved or authoritian or anything like that.  Edit: I asked around some more and people said that I was idealistic (like for example I go to an extremely crappy restaurant and somehow still think it's awesome even when it was obviously dirty and customer service was poor lmao)**20) You got a whole day to do whatever you like. What kind of activities do you feel like doing?**I would probably go downtown and eat out and sit on a coffee shop's wifi to chat on reddit or something and browse memes, or spend time with my friends and buy a bunch of junk food that I can never finish and use my phone a lot. It depends lol",Am I an ESFP?
1163,ESFP,"Greetings fellow typologists.&amp;#x200B;I am running an experimental Discord server around the idea of putting a limited number of each type together and just having discussions and interactions and seeing what happens.

1166,ESFP,"Hello ESFPs, so I am curious to figure out a few things about ESFP friendships. Mainly, what makes you want to become a friend with someone?

1167,ESFP,"Hi everyone!! I answered the questionnaire at 1. I‚Äôm a 22 year old woman, I‚Äôm relatively short, in decent shape, and I really like wearing make-up. My natural hair color is brown, but I‚Äôve had purple, blonde, and red hair at different points over the past year or so.2. I have ADHD that I take medication for, and mild Aspergers, I don‚Äôt know if that necessarily affects my mental stability though.3. I‚Äôm an only child, and my parents divorced when I was 4. My mom had primary custody, so I lived with her and visited my dad every other weekend. Both of my parents remarried when I was relatively young. I have a complicated relationship with both my parents, they both have a lot of emotional problems that they never resolved or got treatment for. I‚Äôve been in weekly therapy for 4 years, so I‚Äôve been working through childhood trauma and I feel pretty at peace with everything. 4. I‚Äôm currently entering my last semester of my bachelors degree, and I‚Äôm getting a Bachelors of Arts degree in music. I‚Äôve been a singer and performer pretty much my entire life, and that‚Äôs what I intend to do as a career as well. I write my own music, and I‚Äôm currently working on my debut commercial album. I broke a 3 year writers block a few months ago, and I‚Äôve been creating a lot since then. Music, art, and performing are my ultimate passions in life, and I love dedicating time to them.5. If I had to spend an entire weekend by myself, I think I could go either way depending on the kind of week I had before. If I‚Äôve over-extended myself a lot prior to that weekend, then I‚Äôd probably be fine with hanging out by myself and just spending time in my own head. I tend to get under stimulated as well though, so if I wasn‚Äôt active enough the week prior, I would probably have a lot of pent up energy. If I could go out and exercise and be outside and burn off some steam though, I would be fine being by myself all weekend. I tend to get stuck in my head sometimes though, and if I‚Äôve been there too long, I have a hard time being by myself.6. I love reading, writing, traveling, skiing, riding bicycles, hiking, learning new things, watching movies and documentaries, working out (although I‚Äôve been out of the habit for a while), and watching music videos and interviews. I ran cross country at the beginning of high school, but I wasn‚Äôt very good at it. I‚Äôm not super into sports, I prefer to exercise and spend time outside in an unstructured setting. I tend to get cabin fever in the winter because I get a lot of pent up energy when I‚Äôm inside and inactive too long. I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to heat and humidity too, so when it‚Äôs really hot out for a few days, I get cabin fever from being inside and inactive as well.7. I consider myself a very curious person. I love learning about and researching new things, but I tend to overwhelm myself with information. A lot of the time, I learn about something just because I think it‚Äôs interesting, without any initial plan of doing anything with the info. I like to talk about interesting things I‚Äôve learned with my boyfriend, and I love sharing that info with him. I love books and I have a ton of them-I order a lot of them from amazon prime and I have a pretty big library. I love reading biographies about people who have made an impact on the world, mostly in the entertainment industry. I like to learn about their lives, and I try to figure out what made them successful, and what mistakes they made. Basically, I try to learn from their experiences. Most of the things I learn about are for my own self-growth. I love MBTI and the enneagram, and I used to spend a lot of time learning about psychology. I don‚Äôt really spend much time learning about technology, although I do like to predict how it may affect general life and the music industry. I‚Äôve pondered existential topics like spirituality, reincarnation, and philosophy, but if I go too far with that I end up with a lot of anxiety. I‚Äôm interested in how the universe works, but I‚Äôm not very good at math, so I usually focus on the theory end of science.8. I‚Äôm not sure if I would enjoy being in a leadership position. I think I‚Äôd enjoy motivating people and helping them reach their potential. If someone pisses me off or crosses a line with me, I don‚Äôt tend to be super tolerant of BS, but I‚Äôm generally a patient and understand person.9. I‚Äôm not really a coordinated or uncoordinated person. I‚Äôve never broken any bones or been seriously injured, so I‚Äôm not particularly clumsy. I don‚Äôt consider myself super graceful either though. I like playing instruments, so I‚Äôm good with my hands in that sense. I‚Äôm not very good at drawing though, and I don‚Äôt really enjoy tinkering with machinery.10. I‚Äôm very artistic. I write and perform my own music, and I like to come up with visual concepts for my music. I‚Äôm drawn to dreamy, kind of surrealistic imagery, I love old movies(black and white or technicolor). Color is really important to me, I‚Äôm profoundly affected and inspired by aesthetics.11. I tend to not think about the past unless there‚Äôs something I can learn from it, or unless I‚Äôm writing or creating something about what happened in the past. I like to make the most of the present because of the general uncertainty of the future. I try not to worry about the future, I‚Äôd rather do my best in the present.12. I have a hard time saying no when someone asks me for help with something, but I‚Äôve learned how to do that I can maintain my own sanity. I won‚Äôt help somebody if what they want me to do would enable them to be unhealthy. 13. Yeah I mean I guess. It can be frustrating when stuff doesn‚Äôt make sense.14. Productivity is important to me in the sense that I like to work towards my goals. If I don‚Äôt care about something, I don‚Äôt care too much about being productive and efficient.15. I‚Äôd like to think that I‚Äôm not a controlling person, although I can be if I super stressed out. It‚Äôs usually pretty indirect though, I can be rather passive aggressive.16. The activities I listed in number 6 are pretty much all my hobbies. Music is in there too.17. I suck at the whole standard academic structure. I have a hard time turning things in on time if I‚Äôm taking a full class load. I get really overwhelmed and burnt out pretty quickly. If I don‚Äôt care about what I‚Äôm learning about, I just don‚Äôt really do it, which isn‚Äôt great. I kind of just need the freedom to do things in my own way in my own time. I can‚Äôt have anyone breathing down my neck and pressuring me either.18. I‚Äôm not very good at breaking things down into pieces and prioritizing them. I just do things in the order that makes sense to me in the way that feels right. I just go with my gut for the most part.19. I really want to make an impact on the world through music and art. Personally, I want to feel happy and fulfilled. I want to be intellectually and creatively stimulated. I want to give love and be loved.20. I‚Äôm afraid of going insane, that‚Äôs a big fear of mine. Living a meaningless life and wasting my time and potential is another huge fear. I hate being bored, feeling stuck and uninspired, and feeling like I don‚Äôt have the option to live life the way that I want to.21. The highs in my life have involved positivity, acceptance, excitement, creative inspiration and productivity. There‚Äôs been a lot of positive spontaneity, and I‚Äôve been surrounded by like minded people who I‚Äôve bonded with.22. The lows in my life look like pretty much like the opposite of my highs. They‚Äôve been filled with depression, anxiety, boredom, a lack of creativity, and crippling loneliness.23. I tend to do both of those things. I‚Äôm aware of my surroundings while I daydream, usually my surroundings have some influence on my daydreams.24. I‚Äôd probably wonder how I go to that room and why I‚Äôm there. I‚Äôd probably just observe and take it all in, and then figure out what I should do, if anything.25. It depends on what the decision is. I‚Äôll usually consider and weigh the options and pick the one that makes the most sense. I usually don‚Äôt change my mind after I‚Äôve made an important decision because I trust my gut in picking the right path.26. I take a really long time to process emotions because I sometimes have trouble knowing why I‚Äôm feeling something, or what exactly it is that I‚Äôm feeling. Emotions are important to me, but I have a love/hate relationship with them. I don‚Äôt like being bogged down by negative emotions and being unable to get out of that rut.27. It depends if it‚Äôs worth it for me to agree with them. Sometimes I‚Äôm just so over it with a conversation that I‚Äôll agree just so the person stops talking. If I enjoy the conversation and the person I‚Äôm talking to, I‚Äôll express my actual opinion on the topic, whether that‚Äôs in agreement with them or not.28. I‚Äôm not a huge rule breaker, I‚Äôve never been in trouble with the law or anything like that. But if the rules are corrupt, then I think it‚Äôs okay to break the rules for the sake of the greater good. If the authority is corrupt or ignoring thhe will or wellbeing of the people, then I think that authority should be challenged.","I think I might be an esfp, can you read this and let me know what you think?"

So I'm extremely aware of how people perceive me and how many will avoid or hate me because of my expression. Often times it causes me to shut down and just avoid people, but then that also absolutely destroys me as an ESFP.

I have more important things to worry about.THINGS THAT MAKE ME THINK I'M AN ENFP:I can plan for the future well...I was told ESFPs don't really do this. I have the names of my kids picked out, the fact that I will be married and happy. I don't know where my future is but I get my joy and connect to people by talking about what we will do, not what we have done.I'm scatterbrained. I'm random.

It ended up not working out between us because he had been so hurt by a previous break-up that he didn't want to be in a relationship and he wasn't doing well in school and really wanted to focus on that. It was a really bad ending for us - I was super dramatic, he was super avoidant, etc. Fast forward two years later and I run into him as he's graduating. We hug and I congratulate him and he says he's moving to my neighborhood. He tells me that we should hang out, go climbing together etc. I say ok, am in a bit a shock.I don't reach out for months because I didn't really have a need or want to. I finally did a few days ago and just asked him if he was settling in ok and if he had started working yet. He never replied. It made me feel really stupid and self-conscious when I had no intention of being anything more than friends since I am dating someone that I really like. I saw him from far away tonight, walking his dog and it just made me pretty upset and hurt that he never replied. Why do you guys (or this particular ESFP) do this kind of thing?

It‚Äôs been a month since I‚Äôve seen her. And she leaves for college In 3 weeks?... ugh :(  What made me feel so hurt was just Friday I asked her if she wanted to go to the beach . But she said she had to work all day. That‚Äôs fine I understand. Later that day she posts on her snap story that she‚Äôs at the fair with her friends... didn‚Äôt even ask if I wanted to go when she knew that I wanted to hang out with her.. like thanks for making me feel even lonely.

1210,ESFP,"So there's this guy (20 M ESFP) who I've known for about six months now and it's getting blatantly obvious that he has a crush on me (18 F ENFP). This guy is a lot of fun and I enjoy hanging out with him, but I've never really developed feelings for him and I hadn't thought about him like *that* until I realised what was going on back in May. You guys are so over the top and usually I love it, but now that all that energy is being directed solely at me it's beginning to freak me out a little. I know you guys are naturally flirty (we ENFPs are too!) but I'm about 110% sure this guy likes me. The touching, the teasing, the fact he manages to sit next to me every time the squad hangs out, the 1000000 not-so-subtle compliments I've received, the fact his IQ drops down to about 5 every time I walk in the room and he seems unable to form a full sentence whenever I'm near him. The other day when we were leaving he jumped in the back of my car, moved my stuff, put his seatbelt on, and was fully ready to come home with me and my two friends. He wanted to go to a lookout or something? He just wanted to hang out some more I think. I had to very clearly tell him no about three times before he actually got out again. He tried it again the next time we hung out and I was like NO before he even sat down and I think he got the message. I don't know what to do with him because he hasn't actually asked me out yet. I feel like I can't just go up to him and be like please stop liking me, I don't reciprocate. He's probably aware of it. I've told him to please stop hugging me, please move over a bit so I have some space, please stop randomly *getting in my car* and he's listened, but without fail he always manages to find some new method. Me being an ENFP means I'm always just a bit too friendly with everyone and I've tried to tone it down a lot with him but when I'm in the moment I'll completely forget that I'm trying to tone it down and I go back to super friendly ENFP mode. Anyway my question is, what do I *do* with him? No one has ever been this forthright with me before and to start off with it was kind of adorable but now it's getting annoying. I really did try my best to see if I could develop feelings for him but I just... can't. There's no spark on my end. The rest of the squad thinks we would be cute together and I'm not getting any sympathy or help from them. If anything they're just making it worse by trying to set us up all the time. I'm moving away in two months, but I'm stuck with him till then. Is there something I could do or say that would be a massive turn off for him? When you've fallen for someone how do you turn it off? Is my best bet to just avoid him till I leave?Thanks in advance my ESFP buddies who I (usually) love and adore because you're so much fun!!

1228,ESFP,,ENFP Male Interviewing ESFP Female Virsaviya Aleksandrovna Se-Fi CS/B(P) MM
1229,ESFP,"Hi, could you tell me which type I belong the most?‚Ä¢ How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.22, Male, Business Student. ‚Ä¢ Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?I don't think I have any problems, at least as a child I was hyper active and didn't like sitting for too long, but it happened when I was with other people and not at home if I was alone with my parents.Perhaps I was also looking for attention. ‚Ä¢ What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?I‚Äôm a Business student and I chose this degree because I‚Äòm interested in an important role at managerial level.‚Ä¢ If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?If I have any goals or interests to reach I would have no trouble spending a few weekends alone, but after a while I would need to go out, working out, play sports or something else. ‚Ä¢ What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?Before the University I played football every weekend, but then I stopped.Now I go to the gym.I don‚Äôt like mountain trip or something like that unless I have a strong interest. ‚Ä¢ How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?I'm curious, I like to inform and know, but only if interested in the topic.I could spend many hours in research, have maximum 3-5 ideas, it depends on the topic and they arise after doing research and having thought about it, generally I tend to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù what I find more than ""inventing"".As a child I liked to draw, but more than inventing I copied what I saw.  When I played the piano I was asked to compose a song, but I wasn't very good at inventing from nothing.I was very curious about nature, animals and science and spent many hours looking for information and I also had encyclopedias.  Even during adolescence I tended to look for topics of my interest and photocopy the pages to put them in a binder.‚Ä¢ Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?From an early age I always wanted to be at the center, to feel like the leader and still today I want to be at the center of decisions, I was and I am very stubborn when it comes to deciding something and it often bothers me if others don't do what I want.Sometimes I immediately make this clear, while sometimes I avoid it if it's not really necessary, but during childhood and adolescence I was prone to anger more often.I think I'd be good, maybe I inspire confidence, but at the same time I could be a little too much ‚Äúmy way or nothing‚Äù.Sometimes I could satisfy the needs of others, but at other times I am very firm about my decisions.‚Ä¢ Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?On an athletic level yes, I always liked running, playing soccer and doing bodybuilding and bodyweight, but I'm better at a physical level than in team sports because I often played in an individualistic way to be at the center.I am very competitive, I want to win and if I lose I could act childish.‚Ä¢Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.As a child I liked to draw, I didn't invent but I copied what I liked.‚Ä¢ What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?I have always thought of the future, setting a goal and ""dreaming"" of reaching it.Sometimes I imagine future scenarios and I think about how to act in those cases.I could enjoy the moment when I‚Äôm in company, but I prefer to think of the future rather than the past.Especially now. As a child I already thought that I wanted to become a doctor and at secondary school I had already decided to start the Scientific High School to have a good foundation for the University.After a short internship I realized that I didn't really want it, but I preferred to be in a higher position and I decided to study Economics.‚Ä¢ How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?It depends what they ask me and if I'm busy doing anything else.I could be ready to help or it could irritate me. ‚Ä¢ Do you need logical consistency in your life?Yes I rely on facts, I‚Äôm stubborn and skeptical and I don‚Äôt change my mind if I am not given a good reason to do so.‚Ä¢ How important is efficiency and productivity to you?When I want something I inform myself and try to have it as soon as possible.I hate wasting time and it could irritate me if I slow down especially if one thing interests me.But I always procrastinated when it came to studying.Until secondary school I was a good student, but then I started procrastinating. ‚Ä¢ Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?It depends.If we have to do something I want it done in a certain way.I could let them do or give them directions, but it irritates me to know if they don't.‚Ä¢ What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?Sports and gym.I played soccer, but it hasn't been a passion since childhood like many I know.  I started at age 13 and dreamed of becoming a footballer, but when I realized that it wouldn't happen, I immediately abandoned.I started gym inspired by Bruce Lee, I started doing research on his training and I followed him for a year, then I decided for a more muscular physique and I did other research and I wrote my own workout.I don't like it when I'm not training and I thought this was a passion, but I realized that it's more a means to reach my goal.‚Ä¢ What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?It depends on the subject.For Sciences, Literature, History and Philosophy I prefer to read and then be able to express myself, while for Mathematics I prefer concrete examples.I don't like to memorize, I want to understand ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and I don‚Äôt like to study just because it‚Äôs imposed. ‚Ä¢ How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?I like to think of a strategy, even in football I played that way and told others what to do: a kind of player-coach.I also really liked Risiko, a board game based on the military conquest of the territories.  Even in the gym I follow a workout in a precise manner and it is designed to do the result I want.  At school I like it less, but I try to organize myself.I don't really like improvising and I prefer to have an initial idea or base to start with.I could be able based on the situation, but I often get irritated when something goes wrong.‚Ä¢ What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?As a child I wanted to be a doctor and already from secondary school I decided to study Scientific High School and then Medicine.  I don't know why, I liked science and studying the human body and maybe I also liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbeing able to treat people.  During adolescence with a passion for football I started thinking about becoming a footballer, but when I realized that it was not possible I left.  At 18 years after a brief internship in hospital I decided to leave because I realized that it was not for me, but I preferred a different place where I could organize and coordinate others and have a more important role at managerial level, Aldo inspired by figures like Steve Jobs, and now I‚Äôm studying Business.‚Ä¢ What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?Being useless, not exploiting my potential and failing my goals.‚Ä¢ What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?I wouldn't know exactly.When I get what I want, when I reach a result even if just reached it becomes ""insignificant"" and i think I want more, when I play soccer and when I go out with friends.‚Ä¢ What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?When I want something but I can't get it or when I fail in somenthing I really want. ‚Ä¢ How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?Sometimes I imagine the future, what could happen, I think about my goals and imagine what it would be like to reach them.Or I just think about what could happen and think about what I could do.‚Ä¢Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?I don't know and it's not something I‚Äôm interested in thinking about.‚Ä¢ How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?I like to inform myself, learn about the various alternatives and come to a conclusion.If it‚Äôs a very important decision I could think about it for a while, but I would like to come to a conclusion right away.The same thing happens when others are thinking: I am impatient and I want to get to the end.When I make a decision I‚Äôm quite determined and stubborn even at the cost of making a mistake.‚Ä¢ How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?Difficult subject, I wouldn't know what to say and I rarely stop to think about it.  During a relationship it‚Äôs difficult for me to express emotionally, perhaps I tend to impose a logic while trying to express myself.I could become attached to someone, but losing it never caused me any major problems.I have always been reserved about it and rarely talk about it. ‚Ä¢ Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?I was told that I‚Äôm very stubborn and that I always want to be right and often I also lost my temper and I was prone to anger. Sometimes I almost don't realize it, for me it's normal to do so.A few times I decided to bite my tongue to avoid arguing: in those cases I preferred silence or I left.‚Ä¢ Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?I follow the rules, but I'm ready to break them if I find them stupid or if I want to obtain something.I respect authorities, but at the same time they must earn this respect.",ENTJ or ESFP?

In the chance he does, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd want a relationship due to point #1. I‚Äôm pretty sure he thinks of me as a friend, he talks to me like a sister. We don‚Äôt talk daily or anything like that, or hang out alone unless he‚Äôs driving me somewhere. He definitely cares about me though, he‚Äôs always been there for me and speaks up for me when I‚Äôm too nervous to.

And the other day, he told me to give him a hug for the first time ever, but then it was super awkward because he didn‚Äôt hug back (although I did it super quickly).

1256,ESFP,"Me: I just wanna be the most hyper and edgy kid amongs everybody.. tbh i am just another attention seeker. I am nothing but a person with high ego, and low self-esteem. In real life I wouldn't be as confident to act like i do online.. I guess that's a good thing from keeping me out of trouble. But the drive is still there, my desire to be noticed by people is far from gone. I've acted hyper irl several times, and it never ended well. I got ignored, ridiculed, persecuted, bullied, and even confronted for what they call as misbehaviour. I might not be an INTP, but i just can't help but notice how the INTP chat is much more loose and tolerating towards people like me. I want something to be proud of, yet lack the ambition to get it. So i started dwelling on my internal side, trying to convince myself that i have something to be proud of, like a high iq. I also seek much more things from the material world than most intps, and i also like physical affection a lot more than verbal affection.. i might just be an esfp, i guess from now on i'll adjust myself from being a hyper edgy androgynous nerd into something society itself is familiar with. As much as i want to stand out, life for me won't be as smooth sailing if i don't be a normie.. I've been bullied by the smart kids at high school for being too 'shallow and tacky'.. I just wanna be noticed and admiredI live in a third world, developing country where first world countries like the United States is most admired by people.I then faked being an american by doing stupid stuffs like speaking english on a daily basis, scrolling through us political pages on Instagram, or scrolling through Yahoo News just to get noticed by my classmates for how 'American' i am compared to them. I have really little interest on actually reading and understanding the news, but much more on 'what others might perceive me as'. Although I know deep down that my classmates aren't really interested nor impressed by my things, i just can't help but to satisfy my desire... And in the process i feel a bit uncomfortable and a bit embarrassed because i know that my classmates would just perceive me as 'someone dumb who wants to get noticed for being out there'I am used on 'American' things nowFor example, I have zero interest on keeping up with news of my country's, because i consider most of them to be barbaric and uncivilized in nature, too chaotic and close minded etc... So i am a bit behind when it comes to what's currently happening in my own country.. People call me ""unpatriotic' and 'picky' for thatI guess im a sensor knowing im the type of person to choose a car solely based on it's lookFor a sensor who loves physical affection and material things, i surely am not intrigued by my 'close surrounding'.. it's true that i basically underestimate anything 'local'",Am I an ESFP?

1269,ESFP,"Hi guys! 18F Enfj here! I'm wondering if you could help me with some insight on an ESFP guy friend of mine! So, here's the situation: We met at the beginning of this semester in college and he was actually the one to initiate that we hangout sometime (he did this 2x, actually) after meeting for the first time and chatting a bit. He embodies the ESFP so acutely: He is charming, talented (he taught himself to play the piano and he does so splendidly!), he is adventurous, spontaneous, good at reading people, an intellectual, etc. So over a period of 3-5 weeks, we got really close. He was inspired to to take a year off college to do some traveling around the U.S. and ultimately go to France to learn more about the culture/language/people. I had my suspicions that he liked me more as a friend, but he has also had some petty high school drama with girls so that's why he hasn't taken much interest in them in college. He actually called me his only girl friend here at college. Here are some other signs I thought he liked me (and please let me know if I'm reading these correctly): ‚Ä¢ He compliments me quite a lot, saying that I'm an influencer and that I'm going to do big things, change the world, I'm a good dancer, have a way with words, good poet, good fashion sense, good at reading people (psychoanalysis is sorta what we do A LOT), etc.‚Ä¢ He says I help him be better and since meeting him, I've seen him mature more as we talk and I express things that may be rude or irritating to others and he takes it to heart and works almost immediately to check himself - For ex. He would ask me a question but never let me say, in full, my thoughts. So I expressed to him in a tactful way how that was rude and frustrating and he became very conscience of this since then and let's me say my piece.‚Ä¢ He says he never gives hugs but he knows how much of a hugger I am so he made an exception ‚Ä¢ I was going through some tough times with other friends and I think he tried to console me the best way he could: - hearing me out- giving me the objectivity/sound advice I needed with my emotions being askew- offering me whiskey (imma whiskey kinda gal, what can I say? üòå) - he was actually saving the whiskey for the boys, but gave me another glass because he felt bad and apparently I looked like I needed it- he talks to me about whatever is on his mind, whether it be the latest idea he has, his family, his upcoming trip to France, etc.- he seems to trust me enough to want my opinion on things, whether it be on clothes (he actually had me go to the mall with him to pick out a wardrobe) or my thoughts on people- he actually let me pick out his outfits for the day a couple times* I could say more, but you get the pictureAnyways, so I tell him how I feel about him in two forms: a long message and a poem (which really showed the hopeless romantic in me) I'm quite nervous I might've scared him off because he's been more distant with me (we actually haven't hung out since my confession). We have texted but his are always brief so I match his style when texting back. He basically told me that I was a good poet and that he's not looking for anything right now, which is fair. I just can't help but wonder if he doesn't want to initiate something given his past drama with girls (though he has admitted that I'm a ""smart"" one and mature)? I also wonder if it has something to do with him leaving next month? He's just demonstrated in so many ways that I'm unique to him or at the very least, he cares for me. He wishes to just stay good friends but he's the one making it awkward. To demonstrate that I'm cool with his decision, I asked to hang out along with some other messages and he replied to all of them (in short, concise messages, of course) but that one. I also made sure to add that I wasn't expecting for us to be a couple or anything with titles. I just wanted to continue on the trajectory of our friendship by doing what we always do: talk, listen to music, go on spontaneous trips/walks. I acknowledged that I wanted to be closer to him, but only of he wanted it too. I told him time and time again that I have no intention of keeping him from setting off on his journey and that I am, indeed, happy and excited for him.In my poem, I asked him in several ways to please not do what he's doing now: not letting me know what's on his mind or how he truly feels. I feel he's being very objective, kinda cold, but still composed and cool in demeanor like he usually is. Has he caught feels for me and is freaking out about it? Or am I just delusional and overthinking it? Any advice is helpful. I know I'm asking a lot. TL,DR: I, a female ENFJ, told my good guy friend who is an ESFP that I had feelings for him and now he's being distant. We hung out all the time but now our communication has been reduced to brief concise texts. I'm not making it weird, but he sure is. He said he just wanted to be friends and I respect that, but I cannot help but think he's probably scared. For a guy that's never at a loss for words and gives frequent monologues, he's awfully closed in sharing his thoughts with me on this whole situation. Though he has expressed in many ways that I am a pretty awesome girl, he hasn't told me how he feels about me aside from just wanting to be friends and that he's not looking for anything right now. - Sorry! That was longer than I anticipated üòÖ",ENFJ-ESFP Friendship Awkward...Ruined?

Wanting to interact with people especially on discord, caring about twitter followers, wanting to be chill and not control anybody - sounds like Fe. But the thing I don't relate to, is Fe being good at creating social circles, reading the room, being good with social cues, and being well liked by most. I am a cringelord for crying out loud, ever since elementary school I've been kind of lowkey outcasted, because I'd always overdo it with expressing my obsessions or meme references or whatever. My family also gets on my ass a LOT about acting socially inappropriate, and I've actually been banned from some places. I'm trying to work on that, but my point is it doesn't come *naturally,* like a dominant function should. I'm far from a popular social butterfly, the closest thing I'll be to that is typology discord lmao. I believe that everyone has the right to live their life their own way, we're not here to control each other, nobody is less than as a human, the world (especially cities haha) is a beautiful place, and I see no need for social games, gaslighting or any form of malicious manipulation, I just want to live my life with people I love and do what I love. Does this support or go against Fe?

1306,ESFP,"I‚Äôm a single female ESFP in college. I LOVE going out to parties with my friends, meeting new people and just having a good time. It brings me so much joy and I have so much fun and why bother paying for college if I‚Äôm not going to get the most out of it?  (Partying does not come before my school work, don‚Äôt worry.)Now the thing is, I‚Äôm also a prop assistant for the musical the college theater department is putting on. That means I‚Äôm responsible for helping make props, going to all of the dress rehearsals, and being at all of the showings. At the shows I have to help get props on and off stage at the right time. Not too hard, right?  Except now that I‚Äôve gotten a schedule of when I‚Äôm supposed to be there, it‚Äôs a ridiculous amount of time commitment and interferes with two things I‚Äôve been planning and looking forward to for a long time. This Friday and every night next week I‚Äôm supposed to be there from 5:30 Pm - 10 Pm and this weekend and next weekend I‚Äôm supposed be there 10am-10pmNow here‚Äôs the thing, St Patrick‚Äôs day is this Sunday and it‚Äôs one of the two best party days of the semester. The cops are paid off and festivities go from 10am-6pm, and shit gets W I L D. I‚Äôm going to be a floor advisor next year and I‚Äôll only be 20 so if I go out I‚Äôll lose my job and free room, and I‚Äôm also graduating so I won‚Äôt have another chance to go out on st Patrick‚Äôs day. I haven‚Äôt gone out on saint Patrick‚Äôs day before and I really really want to experience it and this years my only chance. Now in addition to that there‚Äôs a rave next Friday that I‚Äôve been planning on going to for literally a year. The problem is the shows also on that Friday and the other props assistant is completely incompetent and I don‚Äôt want to leave all of the responsibility on the props master who is also one of my close friends. I made these commitments and even though I didn‚Äôt realize how much it was going to be, I should really stick to it.  But I‚Äôm also doing this purely for extra curricular, and everyone else there is theater majors/minors and getting class credit for all of this. Skipping out for parties would be selfish and the entire theater department would be pissed at me. However if I skip out on the parties my other friends will be pissed at me, I‚Äôll be out the $30 for my rave ticket,and I‚Äôm really going to regret missing them. I live for these sort of life experiences and they make up a lot of my favorite memories. No matter what I do, I‚Äôm going to feel guilty and a lot of my friends are going to be upset. I figure that means I might as well do what I want to go and actually enjoy myself, but that would also make me a bad/selfish person.

I read once that this type tends to ""win"" in social situations and I find this to be generally true. ESFPs tend to be stereotyped as being the class clown or like the pop star, but there are other less flashy, notable ESFPs who just know how to work a room. The politicians like Bill Clinton or Chris Christie are two examples. Is this a function of Extraverted Sensing? Given that they intuitively know what people in a group are looking for, so to speak, some ESFP's I've met seem to have a sort of version of Extraverted Feeling.

1369,ESFP," I'm not sure why I have the urge to share this, but I just feel impulsive...forgive me ;)  I only know one ESFP for sure, and only because I forced him to take the Myers Briggs on a long road trip. That person is my dad! :) If I'm judging ESFPs based off of my dad's personality, I'd like to say that you guys really are awesome people! My dad is funny, spontaneous, brave, charismatic, loyal, forgetful, kindhearted, and always does what he feels is right. He can have a great conversation with anyone about anything (which I admire greatly, since I'm shit at small-talk.) My mom is ISTP. They've been together for 21 years and they still love each other. Definitely some communication problems! But they laugh when they both come home with a gallon of milk without knowing the other was buying milk (they've done this hundreds of times over the years and not just with milk.) My dad loves to go on drives to places he's never been, loves to play pranks, loves the new and exciting, loves a good joke, and loves his family. I love that about my dad. He's really a big sweetheart with a million stories. If someone doesn't like my dad, then I seriously question their judgment....but I might be biased (I'm totally not.) Tldr: From the daughter of an ESFP, thanks for being you! I'm glad you're out there in the world making life memorable for the ones you're close to. Continue being great and know you're appreciated!",INFP Opinion of ESFP

1372,ESFP,"So, I don't know for sure, but he kind of fits the bill for it and I'm trying to gauge the best way to deal with our impending divorce.   I'm an ENTJ woman; I've always been the bread winner, always been the one with high expectations, driven, pushing him to be better, helping him with college, the military (I got him enlisted because it helped me), etc. I'm pretty sure the pushing finally got to a point where he couldn't take it anymore and we both just started losing respect for one another and couldn't communicate anymore due to him always taking everything I said as criticism and it was to the point that I used the same tactic I usually do with discuss of divorce and told him to leave and he finally did. He had enough. He's done.   I didn't realize he was really done though, so within a few days I'm trying to talk to him like we're just fighting per the usual, got us in counseling, we had some fights, and then 17 days after leaving, he was sleeping with someone else. Loyalty is a big deal for ENTJ's so this caused me to flip and go on the extreme aggressive side of things which included some vengeance, upping the ante, and of course none of that helped. But why - you ask - would I even want to bother with someone who is dead set on being done? Because we have kids. And part of what made me flip so hard besides the loyalty is that he wasn't really invested in seeing them during that time because he's too caught up in living in the moment.   Well, that girl lasted from Oct 17th to roughly Nov 11 and the last I heard they saw each other was Nov 26. By Nov 28th, he met a new girl and he's only known her for all of 10 days but things seem to be going well there and he's been staying over there frequently. During this time, he has only seen the kids 6 times (Mainly in Oct) and that's on both of us (I got petty on some stuff and he decided to concede everything to letting a court handle the situation).   I don't know if this is normal behavior for a ESFP type person but I do know he has a habit of basically hopping into a new relationship very fast to get over an old one and has a unique ability to just drop people when he wants. So I'm curious if this behavior fits the mold or if it's a different personality type. He's got great charm, charisma, likes to be the center of attention and is constantly changing his appearance to fit whatever job he's in (currently he's becoming more of a country guy and his new dig is quite country herself).   And if he is ESFP - what is the best way for someone with a more aggressive personality type to find common ground? We both currently have an issue with trust, but I need to re-establish at least some basic level of trust in order to work towards co-parenting with him.   We have a custody hearing on Thursday and until tonight, he and I hadn't spoken or seen each other in a month, but I'm the pushy type so I sought him out. With all the deep diving I've been doing into my own personality type, we were able to have a much needed civil discussion of my expectations that his ""living in the moment"" doesn't affect our children and that he doesn't let the flings ever take priority over them. He seemed to agree, assured me he could ""drop them"" if it ever became an issue, but was reserved to admit his habits of going out and partying all the time because he likely feels like it's something I'd jump on and criticize. Which I likely would because he also complains of not having money when he just bought a 2018 car and is funding the attorney since he's the one who filed for divorce.   Either way - I just want to find the best way to move forward and understand him better so that I'm not causing the same waves I did with our previous relationship.       &amp;#x200B;",I think my husband is an ESFP

1379,ESFP,,What do u think about ESFP??
1380,ESFP,"Hi, 20 yr old ISFP here. Guy is 22 yr old ESFP. (Long post and a little nsfw, sorry!) I‚Äôve known this esfp since may 2017. We met on Tinder. We were purely platonic friends for 2 months (he knew my past experiences with guy friends and sex were not good, so he said we didn‚Äôt have to have sex) before *I* was the one who admitted I wanted to have sex with him. He agreed to it. Best sex ever, each and every time since then. Sexual chemistry was crazy. Outside of sex, we just hunt out, talked about our current lives, went out to eat sometimes. When things were clearly getting rough for him, I told him that if he ever needed to talk to me, I‚Äôd be there for him. (That ISFP loyalty y‚Äôall.) He seemed to appreciate this.By Christmas 2017 I developed mild feelings for him and gave him a small present. He was so grateful he almost cried, wouldn‚Äôt stop hugging and thanking me. I told him it wasn‚Äôt a big deal (because I didn‚Äôt want to get my hopes up) but he insisted it was a huge deal to him. He started kissing me and I was hesitant. But I fell for him, and we had romantic sex. After that I was 90% sure that he liked me. Then I confessed to him on Instagram and was rejected, in somewhat of a douchey way. He said I was just sort of boring. Ouch. I blocked him on IG hoping to never speak to him again.He hit me up via text during summer 2018 (I forgot I gave him my number) asking me where I went and that he wanted to see me again. I frustratedly replied that HE was the one who said I was boring. He apologized and said he was depressed over a different girl at the time and took it out on me. When I saw him, and asked me if he wanted to tell me anything, he smiled huge and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs just really nice seeing you again.‚ÄùAt that point I didn‚Äôt even really care how he felt about me, nor whether or not he was lying. I just wanted to sleep with him again. Every time we did it, he was SO good, always going the extra mile, and telling me ‚ÄúGod you‚Äôre so hot‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou just look so good, I wanna go again‚Äù, etc so I knew for a fact he‚Äôs attracted to me. We‚Äôd fuck like bunnies. So we just kept doing that until a few weeks ago.I was afraid where this was going and didn‚Äôt trust him so I put a halt to the sex. I told him if he wants to keep hanging out with me as a friend that he can, but if he doesn‚Äôt want to then I‚Äôd understand. He said he‚Äôd miss the sex but would be down for seeing me as friends, and would make plans with me soon....I honestly didn‚Äôt expect a message from him after that. After 2 weeks since we last met, he messaged me today asking me if I saw this movie, and I said no. He asked me if I wanted to see it with him, and asked if he could come over tomorrow. (He actually wanted to see me today, but I declined because it was too sudden.) I said sure, but reminded him that I‚Äôd just moved and there‚Äôs still literally nothing to do at my apartment. He said he loves my apartment just the way it is, and said ‚Äúnot to worry‚Äù since he will bring multiplayer games. And yes, he was really nice about it. I‚Äôm just so confused. So he wants to hang. But didn‚Äôt he say I was too boring?? Does he feels bad or something ? Or is this a ploy to fuck ? What is going on through his head ??P.S. I‚Äôm not expecting anything good to come out of this. I‚Äôm seeing a different guy later this week who I‚Äôve been crushing on for a while now. I just want some answers about this one. As an ISFP I‚Äôm always on the edge of making some cold decisions to protect myself but maybe his intentions are actually good. Help please. ",Help me decode this ESFP.

I labeled Se DESCRIPTION 1 and Ne DESCRIPTION 2. The things I italicized are what they found apply to me.&amp;#x200B;**DESCRIPTION 1**&amp;#x200B;*‚Äì Are adaptable and easy-going**‚Äì Are realistic and down-to-earth**‚Äì Are practical and matter-of-fact**‚Äì Are excited by adventure and¬†thrills**‚Äì Live ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù and prefer to focus on the here-and-now**‚Äì Are fond of concrete facts and are aware of details**‚Äì Learn best from hands-on experience**‚Äì Seek stimulation by experiencing life in a hands-on, immersive way**‚Äì Have a ‚Äúlive and let live‚Äù mentality**‚Äì Tend to be impulsive and trust their impulses**‚Äì Are fun-loving and optimistic**‚Äì Pride themselves on being bold, unconventional, and spontaneous**‚Äì Prize freedom**‚Äì See all the details around them*&amp;#x200B;**DESCRIPTION 2**‚Äì Are always thinking of possibilities and what ‚Äúcould be‚Äù‚Äì Focus on the future much more than the present*‚Äì Are original and independent*‚Äì Love to start and initiate creative projects, but struggle with completing projects*‚Äì Work in bursts of impulsive energy**‚Äì Hate routine*‚Äì Seek and trust inspiration and are willing to follow it anywhere.*‚Äì Tend to be enthusiastic and good with people*‚Äì Love to inspire and motivate others*‚Äì Find hidden patterns, possibilities, and potentials*‚Äì See so many alternatives that they can have trouble focusing on just one thing‚Äì Are open-minded and slow to form premature conclusions‚Äì See things in impressions and focus on ‚Äúthe big picture‚Äù&amp;#x200B;And based on this I was going ....uhhhhh, when did I ever believe I was ENFP lmao?&amp;#x200B;Because if we're going by the straight, basic traditional definitions of MBTI sensing/intuition, I don't really fall into the ""big picture focused, future-oriented, abstract"" category of intuition. If we just step back for a second, the [very first description I posted about myself on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/94v2ob/type_me_from_the_description_i_wrote_about_myself/), I'm not sure if it embodies what you would call ""stereotypical Ne traits,"" like what I mentioned above. This is a huge reason why I held strong to ESFP for 7 months, I am simply not intuitive under these terms and S/N was the absolute last letter I would've thought would change if I was mistyped.&amp;#x200B;But then we dig deeper into the functions. The Se traits of essentially taking things as they are and not really looking for a deeper meaning, just wanting to enjoy life and caring more about the present are about the extent of what I relate to. But the rest? It doesn't add up. Being adept with the environment, good at quickly taking action, good at and often asserts themselves socially, physically, wants material things to be happy, going out of their way to try new things, etc. Those may manifest in different ways and that's how stereotypes like partying, sports, skydiving etc are created. But the underlying motivation, which is what I'm trying my best to look at instead of the airhead stereotype behavior, does not add up.[http://www.practicalmbti.com/esfp](http://www.practicalmbti.com/esfp) [st=JP6DGWHE&amp;sh=db236ce8](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4tx9b5/se_a_better_fucking_explanation/?st=JP6DGWHE&amp;sh=db236ce8)&amp;#x200B;[https://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/155487328090/esfp-sefiteni](https://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/155487328090/esfp-sefiteni)&amp;#x200B;[http://possibilitywarrior.com/the-tao-of-type/se-extraverted-sensing/](http://possibilitywarrior.com/the-tao-of-type/se-extraverted-sensing/)&amp;#x200B;These are just a few examples, but do you see that similar kind of trend? And that happens with almost all of the Se descriptions I come by, and even when people are talking about Se in the most non-stereotypical way they can I still can't relate.. The whole aura, assertive sort of ""hyped up"" nature of Se doms don't really fit me and I find that the less forceful but more like enthusiastic and excited, hyped up but in a more passive and fan-girlish way nature of ENFPs fit me infinitely more.&amp;#x200B;Plus, based on what I relate to for Si a lot of people agree that this rules out Se dom.&gt;I have a tendency to order the same thing from restaurants, every single time, because I know it‚Äôs good and I don‚Äôt want to like ‚Äòwaste my trip‚Äô on something I might not like. I prefer comfort/stability over constantly trying new things.  Someone once asked me what my biggest problem in my life is. I answered this:  ‚ÄúI think the biggest issue in my life is not being able to really let go to certain things. I can‚Äôt let go of this certain part of my past, this certain group that the universe seems to be going out of its way to keep me away from them, and things that I‚Äôve gotten obsessed with, no matter how much it‚Äôs affecting my life there are certain things I just can‚Äôt let go.‚Äù  I am the most nostalgic person in my friend group by FAR. I have over 80,000 photos in my camera roll with countless memories and experiences I wish to cherish forever, and I refuse to delete ANY OF THEM. And if it‚Äôs an event that was especially important to me, I can easily tell you that we ate at McDonalds at this seat, I got bitten by fire ants on my right ankle, my friend X was there with a Samsung phone, all those details are crystal clear to me. I‚Äôm constantly going ‚ÄúOne year ago on this day X emotionally significant event happened‚Äù to my friends, I‚Äôve been doing it less lately because I realized that no one cares.. but no I don‚Äôt have a problem with memory at all. If anything it‚Äôs pretty good as long as I‚Äôm talking about something I care about. I also have a whole playlist full of nostalgic songs that take me back to the good old days, and I love listening to that sometimes.--  When I‚Äôm deeply involved in something, I find it really hard to take breaks to eat, shower etc. I know gross. I do get to it of course but once I‚Äôm doing something I don‚Äôt want to do anything else. Once I was walking downtown with my friends and because of my crippling FOMO I was holding in my need to use the bathroom for 5 hours and it eventually got so bad that I just had to haul butt over there. I feel pretty dumb sometimes because of that, especially when I get called out for it. ‚ÄúYou forgot to EAT?! How do you forget to eat????‚Äù And I can‚Äôt even give a reasonable explanation for it.  I don‚Äôt really have a problem losing stuff because I just shove everything in the same purse all the time.. but when it does happen, holy crap it is a mess. I throw everything out onto the floor and it‚Äôs just absolute chaos until I can find it. But thankfully that doesn‚Äôt happen too often.&amp;#x200B;Believe me, I have been trying for 7 months to hang onto ESFP and support it using only the basic things of Se I can relate to. But literally everything else does not add up. On the other hand, I find myself clicking and relating to more ENFPs than ESFPs, by fictional characters, internet, real life. After I started being more honest with my self description and included everything and not just the Se sounding parts, according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-P3cKWkEkgyWe4VsHQiQ_wwPCiAxZGqrUsFMZILyxbE/edit) the majority seem to agree that I don't have Se at all let alone dominant Se, and I'm more likely to be ENFP. After I thought about it, I realized that the Si, Fi, Extravert, and general nature just simply *fits* me all the way, and I don't feel like I have to write a certain way, only post certain traits, or twist crap around to relate to ENFPs, it just automatically *clicks* and just simply being myself is enough proof. My profile has a lot of evidence for this. I just simply don't relate to the intuitive part.This is where I'm having trouble at this point, I'm not sure if the reasons for thinking ESFP outweigh my the reasons for thinking ENFP or vice versa.. I feel like they are both equally compelling arguments and both are just as likely and I don't know where to go..

I have a lot of photos and remember the specific dates of the events that were emotionally relevant for me, again because I don‚Äôt want to forget, I believe that they aren‚Äôt truly gone unless you forget about them. I don‚Äôt care about my appearance as much, I obviously take care of hygiene but I rarely deviate from my normal clothing style because it‚Äôs comfortable, that and because I freaking hate clothes shopping in general haha.

I‚Äôm not sure if this would be attributed to inferior Te or not, but I‚Äôm pretty un-assertive and I don‚Äôt like taking the lead for random things just for the sake of taking the lead. It‚Äôs not that I dislike the attention, I just hate asserting myself and trying to act as an authority figure. I wouldn‚Äôt like being above people, I‚Äôd rather be equal and liked than higher and powerful, and plus the added responsibility and pressure is not worth it for me. If it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôm truly passionate about though, I‚Äôm absolutely the first to speak up and let everyone know, whether I not I‚Äôd really ‚Äútake the lead‚Äù that depends, but I definitely show a lot of excitement and enthusiasm if something I‚Äôm passionate about hits. **My main reasons for ESFP:** I feel like I‚Äôm too trusting and enthusiastic about the company of people to be an INFP. I‚Äôve gotten feedback about being very na√Øve and open to strangers even as a child. Canceled social plans just cut so deep for me, I can‚Äôt even explain the overwhelming disappointment when I‚Äôm looking forward to hanging out and then it just gets rescheduled or cancled. I love being with people, especially when they allow me to be who I am and let me show my real self. I love telling stories, making friends, laughing my ass off, and being well known in the community/social life. I feel absolutely furfilled and hyped after a fun social night and I can‚Äôt relate to needing to immediately go home and be alone to recharge. Whole I don‚Äôt mind my alone time, I usually just use it to watch shows or make memes or something, I rarely ever go deep into my thoughts and get extremely depressed if I do. Life is awesome and I think being existential and over-complicated makes things really depressing and weighed down for no reason. I‚Äôve never really seen myself as intuitive, in fact I‚Äôve even gotten feedback for not thinking about future implications, ‚Äúyou need to look at the big picture,‚Äù think about the long-term etc. I sometimes blurt things out without realizing the consequences and doing absolutely retarded things in the moment and then physically cringing at myself as I look back and reflect on it. It looks like a great idea and it looks like the best option at the time, so I‚Äôd go ahead and then it just blows up in my face. Based on my evaluation (and if necessary, my profile shows my previous type me posts), what would you reckon I could be?","Could I be INFP, ESFP, or neither?"
1403,ESFP,"Any other ESFPs kind of bothered by the stereotypes of our type? Even before knowing what MBTI was, I spent a long time acting like an INJ type because I was tired of being assumed dumb, promiscuous, and shallow-- especially in high school. I'm a 22-year-old female ESFP, blonde (I'm sure that doesn't help with the stereotypes), and am interested in fashion and makeup. I like to look good, I enjoy reality television, and going out dancing. But I'm also interested in deeper issues. I'm extremely shy and struggle with social anxiety. I'm not obnoxious... except maybe sometimes around very close friends. :) I'm studying to be a psychotherapist. I'm interested in philosophy and the ultimate meaning of the world. I'm very existential. I write poetry and am a musician. I've had straight As since elementary school. I enjoy spending my time researching. I can hold intelligent discussions. I connect easily with NT types. All of this to say, these things aren't stereotypical of an ESFP, but they're true regardless.&amp;#x200B;I'm finally starting to embrace my actual type, and therefore my actual personality, despite the initial embarrassment and desire to avoid the aforementioned stereotypes. Being an ESFP isn't about (at least in my experience) acting irresponsible and stupid. It's about using the external world to absorb information and then using an internal value system as well as an external reasoning system to sort through that information.&amp;#x200B;It's unfortunate to see that this Subreddit is so quiet, but it makes sense. Anyways, just wondering if my fellow ESFPs feel this way at all. ",The stereotypes about ESFPs are... a yikes.

1405,ESFP,"I personally think it's mostly a load of bs from a judgemental intuitive lol what are your thoughts?&gt;Extraverted Sensation TypesExtraverted Sensation is the easiest function to understand as it simply coincides with what we observe in the outer reality, usage of the body, force, where objects are located in life and biological factors as well as observation of societal tradition and ancestry.This type's thinking and feeling are mostly guided by the objective reality in general. They are the most ordinary in society and live life by the standardized rules and regulations. Depending on the subtype, one's ethics (Se-Fi) or ideaologies (Se-Ti) may keep them from going overboard as far as hedonism goes.Se dominants with Se subtypes are more hedonistic and have less developed auxiliary functions. (A few rappers belong to this type. Ted Bundy may have also belonged to this type and of course was an extreme case.)Most MBTI blogs don't mention the portion of Se that observes and celebrates ancestral history. However, Jung, Von Franz &amp; Van der Hoop have brought this up. It is also a huge piece of information because it is why Ni dominants are said to at times worship ancestral figures or believe they are in ""spiritual communication"" with archetypes. (Feeling angels watching over them and etc.)Se doms are very much interested in biological facts and scientific research based on dissection of plants, animals and etcSe doms were the majority of western civilization during the time of Jung, Von Franz &amp; Van der Hoop.[ Inferior Ni ] Se types are often good at writing Science Fiction stories or telling ghost stories for fun. The Sci-Fi movies are mostly based in fantasies that manipulate biology because they are aware they are absurd and have no chance of coming true. (As opposed to the Ni dom who is more likely to believe in things such as ghosts &amp; etc.) Paranormal horror films such as The Grudge, Idle Hands, Pet Semetary&amp; Sci-Fi movies such as Jurassic Park, The Fly and Tarantula are great examples of great extraverted sensing creativity in movies. (This isn't to say they are Se types but Se/Ni has been applied.)They are the best at knowing how to use force, aggression and the body to reach their goals. This is why they are often said to be amazing athletes.[ Inferior Ni ] -- During times of stress, they may deviate away from their normal mode of common sense and become paranoid that others are doing things against them[ Inferior Ni ] -- In stress or considering people they dislike, they made attribute inaccurate intuitions about them[ Inferior Ni ] -- May suddenly become interested in eastern philosophy , unconventional spirituality or become interested in basic forms of parapsychology such as the ""daily horoscope"" and such. However, they truly don't understand the concepts of such things and leave that to Ni doms.One of the most efficient and happy-go-lucky types out of them all. They can be happy simply being alive and make the most out of the moment.They may like a neat and aesthetically pleasing house, dress according to the weather and sometimes like to flex material goods.[ Unhealthy Se ] -- They may have an intense ego if they are unhealthy and accumulate tons of money. They become flashy, extravagant, shallow, and egotistical. (Some rappers belong to this type.)[ Unhealthy Se ] -- They may expect special treatment due to status and can be classist. They may set certain standards concerning who's ""allowed"" to be seen with them or not based on morals or ideas surrounding materialism. (The women from the movie Jawbreaker and Mean Girls are included in this type.)Sometimes Se types confuse themselves with feelers because reflexive emotions are sparked with sensations at times and can be intense. ( A woman may get a sudden intense sensation during sex or a man when seeing a woman he is super attracted to.) However, emotional intensity is mostly caused by perceptive functions instead of evaluative ethics.&gt;Life Quote: "" I'd rather pay attention to things I can prove and live each day as if it were my last.

1409,ESFP,"Any personality type is probably capable of cheating under the right circumstances, and ESFPs have a reputation for being the flirtiest type, but I feel like they are relatively unlikely to cheat for a few reasons:1. They would not stay in a relationship that makes them unhappy enough to cheat. They‚Äôre more likely to cut ties first. 2. They don‚Äôt have the patience it would take to try to cover up their infidelity. This would require a lot of strategic maneuvering/planning that they‚Äôre not interested in. 3. Because introverted feeling is such a major part of their being, they wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with the ‚Äúfakery‚Äù that would be infidelity. In other words, they need to be themselves so wholeheartedly that they couldn‚Äôt bring themselves to either stay in an unhappy relationship nor sleep with someone else while being in a relationship. Of course, there‚Äôs the possibility that an ESFP‚Äôs impulsivity wins out, and they do actually sleep with someone but soon after regret it and realize how much they love the partner they‚Äôre with. Has anyone ever been in this situation? Some people need to test boundaries and experience something before they can understand it, and I think ESFPs are definitely that type. Also, what about sleeping with an ex? It seems like introverted feeling would stop them there as well. Obviously, you broke up for a reason, and introverted feeling tends to like emotional closure to a point where you wouldn‚Äôt have any interest in reopening that door. Anyone have any experience with any of this?",Have any ESFPs ever cheated in a relationship?

It's almost like she feels embarrassed or ashamed. I think she has a lot of guilt/blame/regret over her last interaction with this person. What she did wasn't ill-intended or even bad, but I think she keeps thinking that if only she had done something differently anyhow, it wouldn't have happened. She had a brief period right after the death where she indulged in a lot of drinking and sex. That seems to have abated, but she won't go to therapy or a support group, and she won't go to the doctor and ask for medication. I've suggested some self-care things like exercise and writing but she dismisses those too.I know the grief process can take years, but I worry that she's not coping well.

1420,ESFP,"Hello I am an ENFP and I recently made a post wondering what was going down with my ESFP friend's attitude.

It's usually related to anxiety. However, this time it's lasted for almost 5 days. The only times she has been normal are when she's back around her boyfriend. She randomly will be amicable and laughing but only when she's making fun of me. She's always been sort of pretentious, but always kind and complimentary. I know she's going through things with her family lately, and she can't go back home to see her family since they were affected by Hurricane Florence. They're all safe though, and last I heard doing fine. If she ever looks grumpy, or angry, and I ask her what's up, she gets frustrated at me. The other day, I gave her and several others a ride to a film festival 30 minutes away, and she didn't say thank you when the others did, and was a backseat driver the whole way. She was rapping along to her rap music, and I could tell got frustrated when I asked her to change the music because it was distracting.

I also want to act, write, and direct film and TV. And write books and comics (and draw comics). And be a comedian. Maybe a talk show host. A singer in a band or solo or both. A detective. A superhero (I legitimately was studying science in college with the aim to get a genetic engineering degree and make me super). Many other things.""&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I have studied the functions and thought I was ENFP but now reading about ESFP and the differences between ENFP and ESFP I don't know! :O I seem to possess strong parts of both. I have strong Fi and can use Te pretty well too which are common between them but I can't figure out if I lead with Ne or Se. And as for Si or Ne I'm not sure I fully understand them to be honest.&amp;#x200B;Ne:&amp;#x200B;I have a basically unlimited imagination. I saw a test once where you had to name 5 or 10 other things you can use a fork for (or a spoon, can't remember). I can name 10 easily. I can name 50, 100.&amp;#x200B;I can think of something random like Godzilla waltzing through a city with a mop, sweeping all the people into the sea, but knowing in the prophecy this would happen dolphins built an underwater shopping mall that he people can shop and walk around in while they wait for Godzilla to die of exhaustion. Then they will rebuild their city in his bones and remember him with a traditional ceremonial needlepoint contest.&amp;#x200B;I can think of a solution to any problem, 10 solutions, more.&amp;#x200B;I love to read fantasy books. Regular literary books set in the ""real world"" seem boring to me.&amp;#x200B;I am always looking for new ways to do things. It sometimes is about efficiency which is very important to me because of Te but I can actually think of so many ways things can be improved or made faster, more efficient, streamlined, etc.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Se:&amp;#x200B;All my sense are extremely keen. I'm a visual learner and I see something I can understand it instantly, as opposed to trying to read about it. I can always notice details and things no one else can, for example I always see hidden animals that no one even noticed. My ears are very sensitive to any noise and I can't sleep unless I have a fan going to block out any noise that might occur. I am a supertaster and find many things way too bitter to eat, like most vegetables and coffee, etc.&amp;#x200B;I also have always been naturally extremely gifted at any artistic endeavor. I have always been able to draw very well even as a kid and was always the kid everyone wanted to draw pictures for them. I can paint well, sculpt well, do any kind of art well without training. I can see extreme details in art and when creating art.&amp;#x200B;As you can see I am also very interested in performing arts, acting, singing, comedy, dancing, improv, etc.I also don't like philosophical conversations like ""why are we here? ""What is the meaning of happiness?"" ""What is good and evil?"" Something I've been known to say is that philosophy is just mental masturbation. It goes nowhere and has no point. It's asking questions with no answers, just opinions.&amp;#x200B;When I'm reading and see a description I can picture it very well, extremely detailed. If someone says something like ""chandelier"" I can picture the chandelier in extremely detail down to the decorative metal designs. I can picture the ceiling, the windows covered in velvet drapes, the color of them the texture. I can see the whole room and all the details.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;As far as focusing on the future and possibilities or the present I don't know. I don't know what I'll be doing in 5 years, 2, or even tomorrow and I like that but I still dream and imagine future careers and scenarios. I do sometimes talk about different ways the world is changing and will change in the near future. I don't often talk about people and what they doing, rumors, etc. but that may be because I have no social life (see other post about having no friends).&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I'm lost here.

However, he can go too far with it and see things when they aren't there. Usually in the pessimistic/paranoid vein, like I am keeping a secret or something or someone's trying to screw him over.

1449,ESFP,"I‚Äôm in a relationship with an ESFP, and it has been great so far (for a year and a half), up until a few months ago. I took a new job several months after we started dating, and I told her I would only take the job if she moved with me. It wasn‚Äôt a dream job, but it was a small step up. The move was hard on both of us. I hated the job when I first started, she was unemployed for 3 months, and when she got a job she hated it. Yet she wouldn‚Äôt quit. We don‚Äôt have any friends in the new place, and it‚Äôs a small town, so it‚Äôs been difficult for us to meet people. 5-6 months after the move I noticed some changes in her personality. She was no longer bubbly and enthusiastic. When we first got here and I realized I did not like the job, she was a huge support for me and said I should give it a chance, find the best in it, etc. However, when I noticed her becoming somewhat depressed, she wouldn‚Äôt listen to the same advice she gave me. And she refused to quit her job because she didn‚Äôt want to seem like a job hopper. I also suggested that she see a therapist, but she said it wasn‚Äôt that bad and she didn‚Äôt need it. She finally resigned from her job but then has gone home for a little while to ‚Äúget help‚Äù and have some ‚Äútime and space.‚Äù I‚Äôm just so confused over her reasoning for doing this the way she did. As I see it, our situation here is very simple: she hated her job, and we have no friends here. That‚Äôs a very dark place for an ESFP to be. Why didn‚Äôt she take my suggestions to quit sooner and look for other jobs? I‚Äôve asked her if she wants to break up, and she says no, but at the same time she won‚Äôt let me help her. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a wall around her emotions (fear, insecurity, whatever) that she won‚Äôt let me break down. ESFPs, please help me understand what is going on inside of her head. What is she hoping to accomplish? I just want to help, but I don‚Äôt know how if she won‚Äôt let me in.",ESFPs and Depression

1460,ESFP,"INFP, F18&amp;#x200B;Maybe this speaks to you the way it speaks to me :,) If not, oh well. It‚Äôs from a letter Jack Kerouac wrote to his wife: &amp;#x200B;&gt;‚ÄúI have lots of things to teach you now, in case we ever meet, concerning the message that was transmitted to me under a pine tree in North Carolina on a cold winter moonlit night. It said that Nothing Ever Happened, so don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs all like a dream. Everything is ecstasy, inside. We just don‚Äôt know it because of our thinking-minds. But in our true blissful essence of mind is known that everything is alright forever and forever and forever. Close your eyes, let your hands and nerve-ends drop, stop breathing for 3 seconds, listen to the silence inside the illusion of the world, and you will remember the lesson you forgot, which was taught in immense milky way soft cloud innumerable worlds long ago and not even at all. It is all one vast awakened thing. I call it the golden eternity. It is perfect.   &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;We were never really born, we will never really die. It has nothing to do with the imaginary idea of a personal self, other selves, many selves everywhere: Self is only an idea, a mortal idea. That which passes into everything is one thing. It‚Äôs a dream already ended. There‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of and nothing to be glad about. I know this from staring at mountains months on end. They never show any expression, they are like empty space. Do you think the emptiness of space will ever crumble away? Mountains will crumble, but the emptiness of space, which is the one universal essence of mind, the vast awakenerhood, empty and awake, will never crumble away because it was never born. The world you see is just a movie in your mind. Rocks don‚Äôt see it. Bless and sit down. Forgive and forget.   &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;*Practice kindness all day to everybody and you will realize you‚Äôre already in heaven now.* That‚Äôs the story. That‚Äôs the message. Nobody understands it, nobody listens, they‚Äôre all running around like chickens with heads cut off.

1462,ESFP,"Haven't found a lot of pages talking about this, so I figured it was high time for me to make one.  So, recently reevaluating myself after coming off of my SSRIs, I realized the reason I started taking them in the first place; my true and utter hatred of Extraverted Intuition.  Now, while I think Ne CAN be useful, and don't think it is a function that should be wiped off the face of the planet, I find myself shockingly antagonistic whenever I'm having to deal with it. For instance, when I'm hungry, I HATE it when 15-20 minutes are spent talking about ALL the possible places to eat in the area instead of just picking something that sounds tasty and then going; in other words, when Extraverted Intuition is unregulated by any judging function and allowed to run amok.  Being an action/fantasy/sci-fi writer, I have been extremely envious of those capable of using Ne to generate fresh, new ideas (rather than doing what I do and recycling old ideas and then changing details so that they seem fresh). When I actively TRY to use Extraverted Intuition to generate a 'new idea', it often comes across as half-baked. However, whenever I go through being moody and insecure, my brain just naturally sets off on an unanchored journey through intuition-land; when this happens, I entirely disassociate and start to exhibit symptoms of Borderline personality disorder, jumping to conclusions, panicking, suddenly feeling like my identity and sense of self is being threatened by all the possibilities, what I COULD be.   In one online source (forgot the link; sorry!), I read that Demonic Ne in ESxPs tends to manifest as ""confusing possibilities for realities"" or ""jumping to conclusions"". Many, MANY people over the years have accused me of ""jumping to conclusions"", and I myself in recent years have noticed I have a tendency to confuse people's ""might be"" with ""is/will be"", because with sensing there is often an ""is"" and an ""isn't"", and so I don't operate well on ambiguity.

1482,ESFP,"Hi, I'm an ISTP currently in a relationship with an ESFP 17 years old girl. We've been in it for about 6 months now. And I think ive lost her respect. Idk how to explain it. She's always loved me. Up until about 10 days ago. Then her love just sort of faded away. She still says she loves me. And we've had our fair share of bad experiences that we've gone through that helped made us fall more in love with each other. She's said things like how she can never stop loving me no matter what. Not once, not twice, but many times and over a long period of time. I could never doubt her love for me. She's absolutely beautiful. She cared for me, showed it, and always helped me, and was there to make me happy. But something happened about 10 days ago. I approached her and she was irritated with my behavior. She said she found it annoying. I felt really bad. Like how could I ever make someone so lovely feel like that. And I didn't understand it either. And then later, she apologized for her behavior and said she just wasn't feeling well. On that same day, I'd approached her asking about how she was doing and if anything had happened. She didn't say anything. She said, she was alright. Even though she clearly wasn't. I'd spent more time with her than usual on that day because I was leaving for a vacation. And later, when she apologized, she told me that she hated that attitude of hers, the attitude that made her lie, and she felt really bad that she'd made me worried. After that day, I went on a vacation with my family. And since then, in texts, she has stopped giving me her attention and affection like she used to. She still says she loves me and misses me but her actions don't match her words.My best guess as to what's up is that, she's losing her respect n trust for me and she still has love for me but doesn't want to hurt me. And we don't text each other as often as we used to because she just doesn't respond much. She won't talk about it either. She really won't talk about anything. She only responds to what I talk about. Or what I need her for. I don't know how I can help this problem. I've tried not texting her and paying much attention to her n doing my own thing. I've tried telling her how much I do love her and showering her with my attention. I've tried asking her about how's she doing. It all ends into nothing. I'm not afraid of losing her. Because I know I won't. But I just don't understand it. Did I hurt her when I told her that I'd felt bad that I annoyed her? She said she never wanted me to feel sad or bad or anything in this relationship. And that she wasn't good for me. I told her it didn't matter if she felt that way, because I'd fallen in love with her n I didn't care if she thought she wasn't good for me. I would keep being there for her. I said all this. But it only pushed her further away from me. That's how I feel. ",ISTP-m in relationship with ESFP-f

1497,ESFP,"#**MBTI**I‚Äôm very sure about being ESFP. I relate to most of the descriptions, I made a couple of type me posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8dxs0c/yet_another_type_me_post/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8hy2xz/type_me_questionnaire/) and got ESFP pretty consistently. I also feel like I line up with the esfp functions (mostly). I know for sure I have fi and inferior ni and the Se description doesn‚Äôt sound too off (apart from being physically graceful lmao). I considered ENFP and ISFJ at one point during this confusing mess but they don‚Äôt match nearly as much as ESFP does. Here are some Mbti ESFP descriptions that resonate with me: &gt; ESFP is definitely a spontaneous, optimistic individual. They love to have fun. If the ESFP has not developed their Thinking side by giving consideration to rational thought processing, they tend to become over-indulgent, and place more importance on immediate sensation and gratification than on their duties and obligations. They may also avoid looking at long-term consequences of their actions.&gt; The ESFP is a great team player. He or she is not likely to create any problems or fuss, and is likely to create the most fun environment possible for getting the task done.&gt; Utterly social, ESFPs enjoy the simplest things, and there‚Äôs no greater joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends.&gt; There‚Äôs nothing that makes ESFPs feel quite as unhappy as realizing that they are boxed in by circumstance, unable to join their friends.&gt; ESFPs sometimes ignore and avoid conflict entirely. They tend to say and do what‚Äôs needed to get out of such situations, then move on to something more fun.&gt; #**Authority and social status are secondary to feeling like they‚Äôre an important part of a team that gets the job done.**&gt; Sounds like a great idea! They don‚Äôt even care where they are going, as long as they get to hang out with friends and have a good time.&gt; ESFPs hold values of sympathy, tactfulness and care toward their peers. ESFPs can appear casual, flexible and easy-going, but when they feel something or someone they value has been slighted, they will stand firm and stubborn.&gt; Se-doms can be emotionally triggered in a variety of ways, such as: being judged as immature or superficial or incompetent, feeling that others doubt the legitimacy of their talents or achievements, not receiving positive feedback for their work, being criticized when they have put out a lot of effort, spending too much time with overly serious or impractical people, working with inflexible/cynical/uncooperative/incompetent people, being pressured to make long term commitments, being pressured into making decisions that can have a major impact on future developments, feeling as though alternatives or options are being closed off, being forced to work in excessively structured environments, enduring rigid routines or procedural work for long periods, feeling pressured to conform to other people‚Äôs rules or schedules, tight deadlines or onerous supervision, feeling a lack of stimulation or variety, feeling disorganized or mentally clouded, feeling unable to solve problems quickly and efficiently, being overwhelmed by too many duties or a heavy workload.#**SOCIONICS**Now that I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not mistyped in mbti, I went on to read some of the socionics descriptions and see what it had to say about ESFPs. I found a whole ton of crap like &gt; SEE ‚Äì ESFp ‚Äì Napoleon (Leader)&gt; The SEE is characterized by the drive to expand his influence, by the desire of authority and glory. In order to realize these goals it is necessary to learn how to control people, by manipulating their weaknesses and avoiding their strengths so as to never be conquered.&gt;  Se doms tend to use the physical aspect of power to sway others. This includes but is not limited to intimidation, gaslighting, persistence, among others. Some dial up the charm, knowing that a lot of ppl respond to easy going ppl sometimes more drastically than the intimidation route. These are the aw shucks types that seem to always be down to do things with others, hoping their charm will convince others to comply.&gt; ""I - the most powerful man in the world, rookie."" &gt; It is very self-confident in their own abilities, he believes that can do everything. Often the impression voluntarist: I think it's right, then it should be good for everyone. It produces an impression of a strong man, he seemed to always have enough space around, ""like a bull in a china shop."" If he is physically strong, that despises ""wimps"", if the opposite is weak, then all athletes - ""redneck"". Often good handle money, but these issues are either too conservative or too cocky. Life is perceived through the prism of power ""who is who"". In order to be heard by them, you need to force yourself to respect in any way. Any weakness of man perceived as a disadvantage, so often they can use it, not seeing anything wrong. Always do something, developing skills. Usually, their strength is visible to the naked eye, but it lacks flexibility, rather it is something monumental and conservative. Always try to be just the first in any case, if this does not work, something very angry. If their strength and ability to question, it should also be a flash of aggression. Potentially - excellent athletes, but a constant re-evaluation of their own forces is fraught with injuries. Preaches the cult of power and skill, confident in their external data. It asserts its exclusivity, uniqueness. He does not consider it necessary to get someone on the approval of this or that act, and the decision is made ‚Äã‚Äãby a very arrogant. Do not hesitate to use force anywhere. Angry, annoyed, if someone it ""contradict"" and is externally visible. &gt; SEE - this is a strong, domineering personality. A girl of seven years creating a lot of problems to parents: she fights with anyone who contradicts her in something. And most importantly, that she wins even in a fight with the boys.&gt; Even he likes to control people, or rather, it is in the blood. The chief-SEE everything must be subordinated.&gt; The individual feels at home among people who are actively doing something and interacting with each other directly (visibly), and is able to organize people, move them around as necessary, and guide them in achieving a specific goal. He or she likes obedience and even subservience in others, since it allows him to ""make things happen"" more effectively.#Geez, what happened?!??I know if you‚Äôre on r/mbti you‚Äôve probably gotten sick and tired of me obsessing over this stuff. But seriously. I can relate to jack squat in socionics but I‚Äôve never been more sure of being ESFP in mbti.

But that‚Äôs still confusing, because I thought the p and j were only supposed to switch for introverts?I came here to see what y‚Äôall thought.

1505,ESFP,"ESFP's have been a reoccurring love interests in my life.&amp;nbsp;I've been in love with this one ESFP since the very start of High School, at the beginning I thought she wouldn't even notice me, but for some strange reason we actually got pretty flipping close. Hugging, Pecking each other on the face every chance we get etc. etc. But I've always been conflicted about if I should make the move. The main reason is that I LOVE that caring, loving, compassionate side of here, where we just do nothing but hold each other, but I always feared that I would let her down if we were to get into a relationship. She loves to go out to parties every single weekend, and I absolutely HATE such crowded places. It's the biggest part of her social life and I just feel like that's going to be a big disconnect. Heck we even went out on 2 dates, to which SHE asked ME to, and I probably wasn't ever going to do it because of me being so conflicted. She's told everyone about me, like I used to be a pretty unknown figure around town, but she's talked to everyone about me I feel like 70% of the city that's our age knows about me now. She used to say that she loves how unique I am, how I have my own opinions and don't change them for anyone, how I'm not a person you meet everyday, how I have my own beliefs and values etc. And she used SOOO MANY signs that she likes me and wants to be with me, and she probably thinks I didn't notice any of them, but Oh I did, I noticed every single one of her body language signs I'm just a flarking idiot for not doing ANYTHING about it.&amp;nbsp;And now, I've lost her... And I don't blame her, she got tired of waiting on me she just got into a new relationship. And I convinced myself for a very large portion of time since then that I didn't care. Because the previous ""crushes"" I had that got into relationships always ended with me having big emotional outbursts, and I didn't have any when she got into a relationship. I just said to myself that we weren't for each other anyway because of how Extroverted she is, and because of how much I don't show emotion and just hold it all inside.&amp;nbsp;And with having her out of the picture I started noticing that I still have crushes that are ALL YOU! ESFPS! MY CURSE! I'm Cursed with loving creatuers that I can't have. I discovered this other girl that's a year younger than me that actually SAID that she likes me just from how I look and brief moments of her overhearing my conversations. But I sure as hell ain't gonna do nothing about it BECAUSE I'M A FLARKING INTROVERT THAT DOESN'T OPEN UP TO ANYBODY!!! (I'm not that introverted, I'm actually pretty talkative and whenever I take the online tests I usually get a good 54 to 46 percent Introversion to Extroversion, it's just that it doesn't matter how talkative and fun I am, I just don't show my inner emotions towards people and it's holding me back). And even tho this new girl is pretty cute and I'd really like to be with her, I still feel like the previous one is a 100% the perfect match for me. Sure she has a pretty extroverted social side but that's just 1 disconnect between us, we have so much in common, and we got sooo close to the point that we spent whole days close to each other.&amp;nbsp;But, maybe there's another option. Maybe I didn't actually love her truly, I think I just enjoyed having that closeness to someone. I've never been in a true relationship, and If anything I'd say that this relationship is the closest thing I had to an actual relationship because of that physical connection. She started the hugging and the kissing and I just enjoyed it to it's fullest. I don't know if I'll ever get to do that again. That's stopped now, we've stopped talking as much and the most physical connection we have is a quick hug... And I think that's what I miss the most.&amp;nbsp;Ok, I finished venting and ranting. I needed an outlet to just get it all out of me. I really, REALLY hope she doesn't get out of that relationship because I know as soon as she does she's gonna get close to me again and I'm gonna be destroyed. At least now I don't feel as strong emotions as I did when she was single, and if she gets single again we are a 100% gonna start hugging and kissing again and I  don't know if I can take it. I just know I'm not gonna do anything about it again and if I do it's going to be disappointing. If she does do that again I think the smartest option for me to do is to just say that she needs to stop being so physically close to me, that way there's some distance between us and I can fully get over her. &amp;nbsp;Seriously tho, you people need to tone down your attractive personalities, both the emotional and outgoing sides. My heart can't take it.","INFP here, can you stooooppp being so attractive?"

1517,ESFP,"Does this sound like esfp- I don‚Äôt mind listening to your ideas, but if don‚Äôt have any intention of putting them into action I‚Äôd rather not waste my time. - I focus on the present but occasionally I get nostalgic.- I get bored if you try to talk about my future. I try to waste as little time on that stuff as possible. Things don‚Äôt stay the same and more often than not you‚Äôre going to end up adapting to the changes anyway.- I find that the emotions of the people around me influence me a lot. If I‚Äôm around someone who‚Äôs cussing at their phone or someone else, I feel uncomfortable. If I‚Äôm around someone who‚Äôs always laughing and talking and making jokes and stuff, I feel encouraged to do the same.- I feel awkward when I‚Äôm alone and I‚Äôd rather be around a lot of people. - I find myself needing a lot of affirmation.- I find myself focusing on the details in the real world more than details about myself.- If it doesn‚Äôt have a deadline, it isn‚Äôt getting done unless it‚Äôs actually important to me.- I‚Äôd rather spend time having fun and being happy as much as possible than doing chores and dwelling over stuff that doesn‚Äôt affect me right now. - When I‚Äôm cooking, I‚Äôd rather have an actual recipe with proportions so I know what the heck I‚Äôm doing. - I‚Äôd rather rely on facts that are confirmed and true than fluffy theories that may or may not be accurate. - I don‚Äôt care if plans change at the last minute. It happens. It just opens up more options. - It‚Äôs very important to me to be accepted and liked in my community. - I think drama is rather exciting and fun to have in my life. But when it goes too far and starts to screw things up, that‚Äôs when I start to get really nervous. If it gets to that point I‚Äôll try to act happy and upbeat and try to make others feel the same way and maybe make the drama less threatening, but if it obviously isn‚Äôt helping I‚Äôll just sit there and shake with anxiety. - I find that commercials and ads with an emotional appeal have more of an effect on me than ones with a bunch of numbers and percentages. - People are always telling me to think before I speak but I never do that. - If something is important or significant to me, I‚Äôll remember a lot about it. - It makes me feel sooooo awful when for whatever reason I have to stand far away from a group of people. I‚Äôd much rather be among them.- I hate relying on strict plans because I‚Äôve never seen one work out the way it‚Äôs supposed to. *Things change.*- If I feel strongly about a subject, I have absolutely no problem expressing my feelings about it. But if it‚Äôs likely that it will cause a conflict or a giant argument, I‚Äôll just keep my mouth shut. - I can say something with confidence for once: I‚Äôm a procrastinator. As I said in my previous post, if it isn‚Äôt affecting me or my loved ones right this second, it doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôll only do it if I absolutely have to, and most likely I‚Äôll start it the same day it‚Äôs due. - I can‚Äôt take criticism. It comes across to me as an insult and makes me feel like crap. - If I‚Äôm being disrespectful, I‚Äôm not doing it on purpose. I‚Äôll most likely apologize if you bring it to my attention.- I love assignments and essays that allow me to express myself. - If someone has a suggestion that we are able to act on *right now,* I‚Äôm always the first one to jump out of my chair and go. If it‚Äôs a suggestion that may or may not happen in the future, I don‚Äôt waste any time or energy on it. Because I know from experience that those lovely little ‚Äúpossibilities‚Äù and ‚Äúideas‚Äù never work out if it requires too much planning in advance. - If I do something foolish that causes me to be ashamed, I‚Äôll try to distract myself from it with other things. If I‚Äôm unable to do that and I‚Äôm left alone with my thoughts, I feel like garbage.- If I ask someone a question and they don‚Äôt answer in .00000000009 seconds I assume they didn‚Äôt hear me or they‚Äôre ignoring me. - I feel like I can go forever without being alone and that would actually be great lol. - As much as I want to keep your secret, more times than not I‚Äôll spill the beans without even realizing it. - I don‚Äôt mind a loud environment. I think it‚Äôs really awesome.- I‚Äôll tell a complete stranger pretty much everything that‚Äôs going on in my life and how I feel about it. I‚Äôve gotten into a ton of trouble because of that. - I honestly don‚Äôt like being in control or in a leadership position lol. I‚Äôd rather let someone else take care of that stuff and I can just go with the flow.- If I do end up making a to-do list I‚Äôll never follow through with it. - When I‚Äôm at a restraunt I tend to order the same thing because I‚Äôm comfortable with it. But if someone suggusts something to me, unless there‚Äôs a really good reason not to get it, I‚Äôll try it. - When I visit someone‚Äôs house and it‚Äôs cluttered and messy, I actually admire it. It comes across to me as they‚Äôre living their life to the fullest instead of gushing over how everything is displayed. As long as you know where everything is, it doesn‚Äôt matter at all.

With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)##[You can take the Big 5 test here](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)(it's free, the $29 ""cost"" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click ""no thanks"")**Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.**Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.-----[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)&gt; * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven‚Äîsometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.&gt;* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.&gt;* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.&gt;* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.&gt;* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):&gt;The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.",Big 5 Correlations (x-post fro r/INFJ)
1524,ESFP,"If an ESFP was very close (relationship) to you, and carried you in a way as if you meant the world to them, always cared for you, and wasn't afraid of showing you that they love you, and said loving things that went beyond the limits sometimes, and always made you feel special, would it be appropriate to doubt their feelings? I don't think so. But would it?But when I see that something is definitely not good, and they still say it's good, I can't come to a conclusion whether what they say is actually true (not a lie) or they're just saying it to make me feel better?",Would an ESFP ever lie to make the other person feel better?
1525,ESFP,"Idk how or why but they come very easy to me. I know English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Greek, Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, Swedish, Norwegian, and Afrikaans. Idk all of them fluently, but I can get by in most of them and have a general conversation. ",Any ESFPs here good at foreign languages?
1526,ESFP,"I have a good friend who is an ESFP. Before I get into my problem with her, I'll say this. She's kind, she's thoughtful, she's hilarious, she's wonderful as a person and I value her friendship deeply. Our friendship means a lot. She's genuinely special to me and I'm only asking the following questions in order to preserve our friendship. So. My problem. I work with her. At the moment, I work a little above her. She is on a team I am responsible for. And, though I love her in informal friendship settings, she is incredibly immature and unprofessional in situations that require professionalism. We're meeting with investors at the moment, as we need funding for this project. She is manic, bordering on panicked in these meetings. It's genuinely embarrassing to be in a meeting with professionals with her- she stresses out in front of them, scrambles for the answers to questions, has no sense of order when presenting our case, scatters notes across the table, interrupts me frequently, despite me being midway through a presentation. I am also struggling with being technically 'in charge' of her. She is really quite unreliable- she struggles to meet deadlines, and if I ask her for something more than once she takes it personally. If I ask a question to understand what she meant by something in her notes, she takes it personally. She has a specific expression and tone that I know well; it means her feelings are hurt and I may well hear about it later. If I take a moment with someone else on the team, she asks me later why she wasn't included- well, because it wasn't your area and had nothing to do with what you're working on. I love her, I care about her, but I'm getting very frustrated with her. How do I gently ask her to be professional at work? And how can I help her stop feeling like she has to... I don't know, fix things with me? She's also getting to a point where she can absolutely sense my frustration and as a result is trying extra hard. I really don't like it when she tries so hard, I like it when she's just herself- but lately she's been forcing humour, trying to be funny rather than letting it come naturally as it usually does to her, messaging me twice as much as usual, asking me if we're okay almost every day, and it's driving me a little insane. I just want her to be a little more professional at work and know where the line is. I don't want to hurt her feelings, but she seems to be so easily offended at times. It's getting to the point where I'm starting to get irritated with her in non-work settings just because her behaviour is reminding me of what she's doing at work. I'm sorry if this sounds judgemental, I really do care about her, but I'm getting so exhausted with balancing her and work. ",How do I avoid hurting my ESFP friends feelings?

1534,ESFP,"as there are a lot of silly stereotypes and weird typing-questions, im a bit confused because i tested as many types before, enfj, enfp, isfp, infj and well, now as esfp, which feels more right than the others.maybe you are able to help me being sure ( hope it won't be getting too long).most questions are somehow misleading, i have a perfect memory, live in the now but am also pretty much intuitive about certain things.but let's start at the beginning, some relevant memories:as a child ive been adventurous and curious,jumped headfirst into our pond because i wanted to see the fish in their environment instead of looking at them from a distance, that i couldn't yet swim being 2 didn't matter to me.sometimes being a bit impertinent and reckless, loved doing parodies if i felt that something was ridiculous (which very angered my teacher in elementary school because I even did them during class).actually fought with the boys in my class in breaks instead of just enjoying being chased around by them as opposed to all the other girls just giggling and be girly like. in return they let me play football ( soccer) with them as the only girl in both teams.protected a boy in my class no-one liked, they threw his clothes into the girls changing room after swimming class and i was the only one being appalled by such behaviour, took them, marched over to him, gave them back and yelled at these idiots for being insensitive idiots. that's been also the first time when i thought that the others all just were a bunch of hypocritical asses, because even those who judged my parodies negatively because you just don't do that( norms, weird perceptions of what's allowed to do and no go's in society, *sigh) laughed their asses off at the expense of this lonely, shy boy.even though i was a very active and demanding child, i needed alone time and the quiet, spending it with drawing or playing nintendo games.at the age of 3 my parents decided that i should learn to dance, maybe because i was too active? don't know for sure.so i wound up dancing competitively solo for 18 years, but despite training 2 to 3 hours per day, i took riding lessons, played football with the boys, in my teens i even jogged 15 km AFTER my daily dance training of 3 to 4 hours then.sounds insane and it was.then at the age of 10 something happened that turned my world and myself upside down.had high fever for about 2 weeks, nearly died, had visions of angels and such like.so after that, i was diagnosed with hashimotos syndrome, which blessed me with severe brain fog, anxiety, not being able to concentrate for long, a depressed state of mind/feeling and and and.additionally my father chose to be an alcoholic and made my teenage life more miserable by shouting at me, telling me that i would never accomplish anything besides many other niceties.only now, nearly 32, i found a way to selfmedicate and lift the brain fog, being depressed, the anxiety.after years of no contact my father stopped drinking a few years ago.im finding my way more and more back to my true self, but for me it's not going back but forward.sorry that it's gotten so long, im a bit feely right now and had to get it off my chest.so what do you think? edit: in case you might think im  just a troll because there are no other posts or responses, im not...","i may be an esfp, help me confirm!?"

1538,ESFP,"Hi! Female INTP here.I‚Äôm in need of advice. I‚Äôve been working closely with an ESFP for more than 15 years. Of everyone on our team, she‚Äôs the one who I‚Äôve never been able to click with. It makes me sad because I admire her and hate feeling tension around other people.We‚Äôre a similar age, and met in our mid teens (both early 30s now). All I want is to understand how to interact with her. But it seems like every time I see her she shows a new face. Some weeks she‚Äôll seem eager to talk and be friends, other times I feel like I‚Äôm being bullied and ignored in favour of the cool kids. Some weeks she‚Äôll be aggressively show-offy; other weeks I can tell her walls have lowered and she wants emotional support or connection.I am sure that she‚Äôs deeply sensitive. She had issues with her weight and looks growing up which she‚Äôs overcome but still seem triggering to her. She can get really angry at work superiors, but it‚Äôs usually when she feels an injustice. It hurts me to witness that, because it seems like she ignores other people‚Äôs feelings and just assumes the worst in their motivations. I wonder if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening between her and me.This sounds cocky, but I do wonder sometimes if part of our issue is that she‚Äôs jealous. If she feels like we‚Äôre getting too equal, it‚Äôs like she has to lash out and destroy the equilibrium again.In the past she‚Äôs been nicest to me when I‚Äôve expressed genuine admiration of her. But she seems to have an internal idea of exactly how much praise she requires, because too much or too little and she‚Äôs back to being mistrusting of me.Do any of you identify with this? How can I find a way of working together that doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm being gaslighted half the time? Quitting isn‚Äôt an option- it‚Äôs our dream job. I don‚Äôt care if we‚Äôre friends or enemies or have an unspoken agreement to not talk unless our job requires us to.... it‚Äôs the not knowing that is hard.

This natural conflict between us is really stressing me out because I need to work with him on a project. Another thing is, he's very spontaneous and enjoys verbally throwing ideas around, while I'm introverted and like to mull over things internally or write my thoughts down before speaking.

1594,ESFP,"I've been seeing my esfp girlfriend for about 2.5 months now. We met through a friend and hit it off right away. We live around 30mins away from each other. I'm a student while she's a flight attendant. For those of you who aren't aware, flight attendants have insanely tough work schedules which can wreck havoc on your sleep and health; plus the physically intensive work and long work hours can be stressful. But she loves her job and seems to have abundant energy always.The 1st month was great. We'd meet around twice a week (which works out great for both of us considering she gets only 1 day off a week and me being ISTP) and had terrific chemistry. We have similar values and I even had an awesome time with her friends.The next month was terrible for her. Her work schedule was crazy hectic, she lost her credit card and had to shift to a new place. As I was busy with classes during the day and the only free time she had was spent by her running from place to place to sort things out, we had absolutely no way of seeing each other. She had night shifts, day shifts all over the place and things were chaotic. I tried to supportive throughout asking if she needed any help with things. My texts and calls would often go unanswered, and I had no way of knowing how she was doing. She'd get back to me at times and tell me about how exhausted she was and that she'd see me soon but well, I haven't seen her in a month now. Due to the crazy communication breakdown happening (no texts and calls from her side; I'd initiate contact always now, and she'd respond very rarely), I was losing my patience and said I needed a break from things if communication was going to be one sided like this. I wanted to be there for her and help her out but she just seemed to shut me out completely from her life. She got back to me once saying she wasn't ignoring me but it was because of work and her issues that she hasn't been able to talk. I still can't understand how that's an excuse to not be able to drop a one-line text reply a day. There have been days when she wouldn't take calls at all and just disappear from the face of the earth only to get back to me 2 days later. The last text I sent her, she didn't respond at all for 4 days. I just left her a text afterwards saying that she didn't have to do everything alone and that I was here for her to open up to. I just reassured her that I cared for her and she just needed to reach out. I haven't heard from her in 2 weeks now.I've done every bit to try and be supportive but she just seems not want any of it. I don't know if she's in an Ni grip kinda situation or if she's ghosting me, but I've decided to fade out of this. If she reaches out to me, we can talk this through. Otherwise I'm done.Do ESFPs always shut down like this under stress? Is it because of aux Fi? My friend through whom I met her says she has always tried to project an image where she wants everyone to think she's got all under control even when there's a crisis inside of her.

I don't belong here, but I seriously need help so whoop here I is. I've known an ESFP for 3 years now and I adore her more than I've ever loved anyone. She's nothing like the narcissistic, elusive, party-clown stereotype you'd read about on a tumblr description. We were always drawn to each other but were basically strangers. Then over a month ago she broke down crying in an emotional moment and I was the one that held her. I'm still the one that holds her. We've texted every single day since then and haven't broken the streak, plus we volunteer at the same facility so I see her up to three times a week. In the beginning it was quite like the rush of burying deeper in depth, holding your breath in anticipation of what's under the waves. She would text me the second she'd wake up and we'd talk and laugh until she fell asleep. She'd visit me at work and I'd bring her gifts to her work. We clicked on all the things we had in common and were amazed by our differences. She laughed at mah sick memes, would constantly say she loved me. Now it's just not the same. She still texts me when she wakes up everyday but the conversation fizzles long before the afternoon, and I'm usually the one trying to chase the spark. She doesn't visit me anymore, or care what I think about things, doesn't laugh at my jokes as much, rarely says I love you. I feel annoying and worthless, I fear I'm losing her. In person, the last time I saw her I held her as she cried again, but that doesn't mean we really click when we talk. Mostly we just vibe. I'm very boring when we're not working on something or listening to her play music. I'm two years older, so maybe she sees me as aIf you read this, any advice?

Basically we started hooking up together really gradually - probably a bad idea because we work together, but it seems to suit us. He always told me he doesn't want a relationship, and I've never tried to change his mind on this. But recently, he's been ignoring me a little bit and acting withdrawn, as if our friendship doesn't matter to him, when it's always seemed to matter hugely in the past. He's always been really private, so I know there's no point asking him to explain what's going on. But basically, I don't understand why it is he doesn't want a relationship when we get on so well as friends as well as, y'know, the other stuff. Also, why the brush-off? Am I just too needy?

It's seen as irrational, unnecessary and generally a bit shit. I have always used anger as a focus point. Making the connotations a bit more muddy, for me - as in they're not wholly negative. Anything that made me feel unsure or insecure - anxiousness, indecision, confusion, uncertainty - I've funnelled into anger, as in the past I wasn't quite equipped with the mental patience to properly deal with those separate emotions individually.Now this doesn't mean that every time I felt these things, I would break out in a blind fury and release the beast within. It's actually the opposite. I used it to focus myself. I used anger to motivate myself and spur myself into action to eradicate the source these feelings. Hell, I even used it get through my high school exams.I definitely am not the only person in the world who feels that anger isn't a wholly negative emotion - that you can manipulate that vigour to benefit yourself.

We hung out in group settings and flirted/talked a couple times a while ago. Then it led to this. So, we've been ""seeing each other"" for around 3 weeks now. Probably hung out around 4 or 5 times. The dates weren't really traditional though, which i get since ESFP's prefer ""doing things."" I'm confused though. We did sleep together the second time, he tried the first date but I didn't want to. I've come to see he's just a really physically affectionate person, and he's said that too. The thing I don't get is what's going on I guess? I know 3 weeks is short and I'm probably overthinking. It's just when we hang out it's so great and it feels like we're so connected. He alludes to doing things with and for me in the future. He seems to genuinely care, but gets kind personal and pushy with questions tbh. But overall I would think he likes me?? But, in between we hardly talk. He would take hours to answer texts, which I think is normal for him. But still. Now, I haven't talked to him for like 5 days. Almost a week. The last time I talked to him he responded quicker which was weird. Anyways, not important. What I want to know is should I just try and be more casual? Do you think it'd be better if I back off and let him chase me more. Or would he take it as a sign I'm not interested. I don't think so but still. I'm just confused and don't want to scare him off.

1642,ESFP,"So the title says it all. A little while ago this girl who I use to be really close with for over a year maybe two and almost dated that whole time just recently ""found me"". We use to be great friends and whatever else we were until I messed it up and blew her off for some other girl. So over the years I tried to reconnect and it didn't work out she wouldn't have it all, hating me basically. But recently she decided to find me, ended up looking me up and creating profiles on a few social media sites just to find my profile. Now were talking again and she says she has a BF who she says has been just using her for sex and it doesn't look too good for them. They seem to be almost done.Now down to the MBTI part. I've tested every time as an ENFP and  I told her about this recently and she took the test and found out she's an ESFP. We get along amazingly and I haven't really found much a problem yet, communication isn't as difficult as some have said it would be between these two types but I'd like to know if it's just me trying hard to make it work, and if there is anything else I can do? I read that ESFPs like for their feelings to be validated and since then I've made sure I've told her feelings are right and should be expressed. I also learned that Intuitive conversations might get a little stale but it hasn't been a problem so far with her, she seems to listen really well and find my intuitive conversation pieces interesting. Like how I talk about medicinal plants alot with a passion, she doesn't seem to mind. So am I doing this right or am I making a mistake? We seem to have alot in common and she is a great person. If I have to I wouldn't mind sacrificing some of my more Ne thoughts but I'd like to know if I'm starting off on the right foot. She even just asked me if I would use her if we ever decided to date again, almost like shes priming me for it. I'm not trying to get too excited though. Also I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket by relying on the MBTI too much, because ""individuals still are"" but it has helped me understand the way some think around me.TL;DR I an ENFP male might date an ESFP female.

1645,ESFP," I am an INFP who dated an ESFP for about 7 years, and recently ended the relationship. As an idealist I hoped for years that the subtle red flags could be overcome with time and hard work. Things did continue to get better and better for us. We weren't fighting, and generally got along as best friends would. But recently I felt like we reached our peak and I still wanted more... He did everything he could have, and I love him very much but I have realized I am just not IN love with him. He was totally shocked and heartbroken by the breakup, so now he wants a detailed explanation of reasons I feel this way, and why I am not in love with him as I once was... but I am too afraid to hurt his feelings and selfesteem... He told me he needed answers for his sanity, so I tried to as lovingly and tactfully as possible explain some of my motives, but he still can't wrap his head around it. Is it best to keep the details of why I want more to myself or will it actually help him to move on  by telling him what was unfulfilling for me? I am so afraid to hurt him more than I already have but I want to help him cope with this as much as possible. Is this a ""he thinks he wants to know but he really won't feel better after finding out"" scenario? I can't imagine explaining to someone I care so deeply for that there are traits and perspectives they possess that make me feel they are not the person I would be happiest with... like yes you made me happy, but I felt like I could be happier with someone else.

Everything seems to match me, except J/P part. I made the test twice in English and once in my native language. English got me J, native P. I tend to be very OCD, very anxious, feeling like I have to adjust to someone. Rules and rules and rules. But from the other side, I don't like to judge or be judged (sometimes I don't care but sometimes it destroys me by feeling guilty), I want to be free, I want to explore, enjoy my life and do many crazy things. I hate being forced. Does OCD make me J for now, or is it something I try to run away from as P?

Please stop! And help me disect this! So like I said I started liking her a year ago during a school trip, and through out this trip we got the ""you would b such a cute couple"" at LEAST 3 times a day,from different people(one being her close friends and one being her family member) and ended up getting pretty close the last thing she said to me on this trip was ""hey don't think I'm going to stop bugging you once we get home"". Once the trip ended we kept talking, when we met in the halls and in class since she's in a grade ahead of me we only had one class a week together (this year one class a day) and basicly we stayed in touch and I even heard whispers from some of her closest friends that she liked me. Anyway after a while I don't even know what happend well I kinda do I think.... But we just stopped talking and it was almost like she was avoiding me. Like I would be walking down the hall she would be walking my direction see me and would full on pivot and walk away... Things have started to get better again (took long enough) but now when we see eachother she starts smiling and saying hello. But the only time she ever has a full on deep conversation with me now is if she's not with her friends and I'm not with mine, ya I get she might not want to talk to me when I'm in a conversation with a group of my friends... But befor she would always talk to me when she was with her friends, well not always but very often.Anyway like I said we have a class together this semester and she totally acknowledges I'm there... I've even caught her staring/ glancing at me a couple of times. But I don't get what the heck is going on!! I'm fairly positive she dosent like me anymore (not even positive she liked me in the first place, she's way out of my league) infact, never mind that's a story for another day.

1695,ESFP,"Hi all, I [INFP] and my mom [ESFP] have been going through a massive rough patch.  She took the test a while back and it was accurate to a T so I'm pretty sure I know what I'm dealing with here.  She is very controlling and expresses her anger both verbally and physically, while I tend to retreat until I have cooled down enough to forgive her, and so the cycle continues.  What I don't get is why she is so closed off to me emotionally - she has a cohort of close friends who know far more about her than I could ever hope to, and yet she demands to know everything about me.  Sorry to bring to light all these negative traits but i'm wondering if any ESFPs can help me understand what makes my mom tick and how we can resolve disputes properly.

I mean since we're family we do make an effort towards each other but we can't live together or things get a bit heated. My disconnects with her is that she can't talk about things too deeply, she's very limited in that area. It drives me crazy how spontaneous she is, I'm very much a planner so when I go on big trips with her I just want to rip out my hair because hardly anything is planned. Lastly, she cannot stand sad things, she has to have constant happiness all the time. The only movies she'll watch is fluffy comedies. While I like a lot of meaning and yes, sadness in my media. There are of course other things but this is just naming a few. So my questions to you guys are:What do I need to know to understated her better?How do you guys feel about INFJ's?

1707,ESFP,"I'm an INFP and last year I feel deeply in love with an ESFP and I haven't stopped loving him since. In the beginning I took an instant liking to him, which is unusual for me as it takes me a while to warm up to people. But with him I realised he was something quite special and I didn't want to let him go.It was at first quite difficult because I'd never felt this way about someone before and I kept pestering him to see him again and I got really obsessed and I would just end up sending him huge texts about my feelings. It just pushed him further away and so I stopped trying to force things to happen and left him alone. Then half a year later, the opportunity came up for me to meet him again. I decided to change my attitude and try doing things his way, namely, not thinking too much about what things meant and just enjoying the moment. And it worked so well, we became so close to eachother. We worked well together, we would help eachother with our work and we kind of complemented eachother. It was so beautiful and I know that he thought it was too, which felt like quite an accomplishment for me because he always has this strong facade and it felt like an honour to find the sensitive part that was underneath. When he told me I was beautiful it was such a proud moment. Often several weeks would go by between us meeting oneanother but each time we met we would become closer than ever. We were even going to go on a trip to Berlin together.Then it changed suddenly when I told him something that I didn't realise he would get upset about. I won't go into detail about it because I feel guilty enough but the essence of the problem was that I was incredibly naive and he ended up feeling hurt and feeling that he couldn't trust me again.I thought this was the end but after a month of hearing nothing from him he told me he was ready to forgive me because he knew I never meant to hurt him. He said he didn't think he was going to be able to trust me again but that he missed me and thought about me a lot. However, he also said that he thought that we could never be more than friends. I guess he's completely within his rights to say so and I should feel lucky that he even forgave me, let alone want to be friends with me.But the problem is that I love him so much and I want more. And I know that we work well together and so I know I can make him happy. So for the first time since I told him about the hurtful thing, he said he wants to meet me again because he misses me. I don't know what to do because I've never spent time with him simply as friends before. I somehow want to show him when I see him next that I'm worth more than that but I'm not sure how...",How to win an ESFP back

1736,ESFP,"Psychic mediumship and telepathy is expressed throughout pop culture. What this means is that other human beings are expressing their observations about reality through art. Art is a powerful medium which can heighten awareness in other individuals very quickly. Artists take their own life experiences and inner realities and display them for the public to see. Awareness of ESP is expressed over and over and over again in the artistic world. It's time to own up to the truth and be real: we are all psychic. Telepathy is real, and it should be used well (with kindness). We are all psychic mediums, and when we believe in ourselves, we can connect with the spirit world directly telepathically. We don't need religions, other psychics, or authority figures to tell us what reality is. We have our own observations, and when we open our minds to new information, more confirming experiences about the truth of reality. There is no death. There is a difference between being extremely confident in our observations and expressing this confidence to other people, and being authoritative. Think for yourself. Question authority.

1740,ESFP,Me having an ESFP mother I feel like I have a pretty strong grasp of what she thinks about me. But I'm curious what other ESFPs think about INFJs.,How do you guys feel about INFJs
1741,ESFP,"So for the longest time I thought I was an introverted intuitive. I was painfully shy and awkward in high school and so I spent more time in books and video games. However, recently since I've been in college I started noticing something different about myself. I actually appreciate life more when I'm around other people and that I actually hate reading and analyzing intellectual stuff, it's all rather absurd, but I'd rather just be ""doing stuff"". You know, just stop thinking and just go for it! Working out, eating, going to different parts of town, trying out new clubs. So I was wondering, I was born rather outgoing. I loved to sing, dance, call for attention and act out. I was totally hands on guy and I loved the simple things. I've always been rather quirky and ridiculous, loud-mouthed and boisterous. However, I think I turned shy for a long period of time and I didn't have many friends so for years I thought I was introverted. But you know what, even during those years, I think there were times when I unleashed my inner energy and it felt right!So now I feel like I'm coming home and being more comfortable in being my true MBTI, an ESFP rather than the INFJ I thought that I was. But I'm still not sure whether I'm just imagining all this in my head or I'm trying to emulate ESFP behavior when I'm really INFJ because I do plan ahead A LOT, and I'm constantly thinking about the future and my future plans. But also, I'm happier when I'm just in the flow just doing things.

1746,ESFP,"Hi guys; I've been asked to start a series of type descriptions on another site and I thought you guys might find the one I did for ESFP to be interesting. :) I based my description mostly on my understanding of functions, but tried to make the description as general and broad as possible so that beginners could get a lot out of it as well. Please let me know what you think, what rings true to you and what you would add or change! Thanks guys &lt;3(also a special note - Intuitive bias is *real* in the Jungian community.  Being an intuitive myself - I'm ENFJ - I cannot guarantee that every interpretation I have of Sensing is accurate, but I tried my absolute damnedest to describe your Se with as much nuance and love as a I could.  I hope I did you justice.)*****ESFP**ESFPs at their best are perceptive individuals who follow their own path.  They are keenly aware of their surroundings and are able to quickly identify and appropriately react to novel stimuli.  They jump on opportunities to participate actively in the world, readily absorbing new experiences and approaching each situation with a receptive attitude.  They do not miss much, either, and will often notice changes or interesting details before others do.  That said, they do not tolerate boredom or tedium well, and will often attempt to find other ways to entertain themselves.  Their primary interest is in seeking out all that life has to offer, and exploring a multitude of adventures in search of mindfulness and self-expression.ESFPs believe that they will be best able to find harmony in their lives if they stay true to their desires and beliefs and react authentically and honestly to the positions they find themselves in. They will not accept the fact that a particular behavior is ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòimportant‚Äô just because others tell them that it is so, but rather, they do what feels right to them in the moment, searching for evidence to justify and verify their natural inclinations. In this way, they can develop a pattern of morality and personal belief that is independent from that of their peer group or society at large.  They are skilled at perceiving and reacting to the true nature of the scenario at hand and not simply doing what is expected of them. It is important, however, for ESFPs to reflect on the objective facts and information they can obtain from society when they make decisions or interpretations, as the way they personally feel about a situation does not always paint the full picture. ESFPs who allow themselves to explore objective data without making personal value judgments too quickly will discover, with pleasure, that doing so refines their ability to accurately interpret present circumstances and allows them to develop a quicker and more authentic reaction to the experiences they undergo.A young or immature ESFP will not attempt to evaluate the consequences of their actions before they commit to them, and will often find that their efforts did not turn out as they had anticipated.  They also may be skeptical of claims that people, the natural world, or events can be accurately theorized about, interpreted, or predicted.  They will resist attempts to analyze or define themselves, which can leave them vulnerable to the whims of shifting external circumstance.However, as the ESFP grows and matures, they will begin to find a balance between being immersed in the events of the present moment and developing global theories in order to understand the implications of those events.  They will become more skilled at anticipating the consequences of their actions, making decisions based on not only what is seen and interpreted in the moment, but also taking into consideration that which is unseen and unknown.  They will find themselves becoming more skilled at noticing patterns and developing an intuition about people and occurrences, using all of the present evidence they so keenly perceive to check and verify these hunches, and in doing so will further develop their ability to react appropriately to novel conditions.  That said, ESFPs will always be more flexible and observant than most other types, quick to respond and jump into interesting and exciting ventures, and rarely allowing their beliefs or expectations to cloud their awareness of what is really going on.Mature ESFPs are often very good at seeing things from other people‚Äôs perspectives and sensing how they are feeling or responding to the circumstances at hand, but they often do not find much pleasure or gratification in engaging with this ability unless it‚Äôs in service of some larger goal or in order to help someone they care about.  Because they are so focused on drinking in every facet of their present situation, they resist the task of noticing patterns and forming conclusions based on how things have worked out in the past for them.  However, when they are sufficiently motivated, they are very skilled at doing so, and those who allow themselves to practice this skill will discover it to be very useful when they find themselves stuck in a rut or seeking guidance for an important decision.ESFPs do not enjoy evaluating facts and arguments for internal consistency and are prone to making careless errors in reasoning.  They will often prefer to delegate this task to someone they trust to do it better.  That said, they are capable of doing it - begrudgingly - when no help is available.  ESFPs find it very difficult to conceive of every available outcome, idea, or possibility that could spring from the present moment in time, and cannot help but believe that things ‚Äúare what they are‚Äù and have the internal sense that the world is unlikely to change much.  They also have relatively modest expectations for the results of their decisions and generally do not feel that individual choices are of dire importance.  Although they may, with much determination, be capable of success in leading and directing grand, ambitious projects, it is not where they thrive.  They prefer to explore the world actively and spontaneously, reacting in the moment, doing what seems right, and letting the chips fall where they may.To summarize, ESFPs are perceptive and genuine individuals who seek to discover as much as they can about the world around them and themselves.  They do so by actively participating in as many experiences as possible and by being true to themselves and their own beliefs.  When they balance these capabilities and desires with an eye on objective facts as well as their internal sense of what seems likely to happen and be meaningful, they can make astounding discoveries and impressions in the world, leading others to open their eyes to a new sensation of awareness and realizations that they had never grasped before.",My type description of ESFPs!

(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. (ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees.

1792,ESFP,"Hey guys, it's been a long journey for me. Making it short I'm an ESFP who experienced a trauma right before entering my teens which caused me to retreat from the world and live in denial about a lot of things for 5 years. Ever since my trauma, nothing has felt the same again and after ""coming out of hiding"" last year I was overwhelmed at how different myself and the world was. 5 years of hiding can really do you in and I found myself living in the body of anxious adult and experiencing an incredibly confusing, deep, painful and emotionally draining personality crisis. Fortunately, I discovered Myer Briggs which helped me a lot and was able to surround myself with several of great people who took me in despite my anxiety, etc. Fortunately, my body has loosened up over this last year and things are getting much better but my heart still craves to become whole again...to reunite with the cheerful, uninhibited and fun-loving person who I grew up as except now as an adult. I love performing and entertaining the people around me but now I don't know how my performing would look like as a 20 year old...I don't know how  my younger self would have developed into an adult if it weren't for that trauma. I need to get my performing identity back..back when I as younger I had a feel for the world and I had a grasp over my ability to perform (what would work and what wouldn't). Right now, I don't have that performing identity . I'm afraid to perform and make mistakes since I'm older now, I'm afraid of making a fool out of myself/being misunderstood, I'm afraid of forcing things and not seeming natural. I look back at my younger self a lot and remember how he performed but I can't bring that person out anymore (completely) because I'm an adult now so yeah my performing would be different. Guys, I miss feeling happy, calm and letting my spontaneity naturally run loose. An uncle of mine who I run to for help tells me that since I'm an adult now..things are going to be different and that I can perform now by being a good conversationalist and letting witty comments fly when the occasion pops up but I know that isn't the whole story. I still don't feel ""free"" and I find that I'm still conservative socially. My younger self was more over the top, outrageous, energetic and I want to bring that side of me out again. So my question guys is..how do you perform and liven things up as an ESFP? Thanks guys!",How do you perform as an ESFP?
1793,ESFP,"Hello there!Brace yourselves, it's going to be a long post/rant.I'm a 31yo INFJ, female, and I need advice about how to deal with my mother in law. I know, clich√©, right? :)I have been married 6 years now and I'm very happy with my husband. However, things aren't always easy when it comes to my relationship with my MIL. It doesn't help either that we live very close to my husband's family and really far away from mine (so far, and tickets are so expensive, that it's been 3 years since I've been with my family). So this kind of intensifies the problems for me because I can't go and have some ""my family"" time when my in-laws stress me out.My MIL has never taken the test but I'm pretty sure she types as ESFP. But the worse thing is that I believe she also suffers from Histrionic Personality Disorder. Now I'm no Psychologist, but she has many of the symptoms, the only one obviously missing being the seductive behaviour. She does however fit this to a T (from Wikipedia):The World Health Organization's ICD-10 lists histrionic personality disorder as:A personality disorder characterized by:-shallow and labile affectivity,-self-dramatization,-theatricality,-exaggerated expression of emotions,-suggestibility,-egocentricity,-self-indulgence,-lack of consideration for others,-easily hurt feelings, and-continuous seeking for appreciation, excitement and attention.Even if she doesn't really have HPD, that list above pretty much sums up her behaviour. I know a lot of the things she does are with good intentions. She cares about her family. My problem is that, even after more than 10 years knowing me, she doesn't really *know* me. She has picked up a few hints about the kind of thing I don't like along the way, and I'm grateful for that. But still she pursues me - I could even say sometimes I feel like she *stalks* me. For instance, like a good INFJ (or an introvert for that matter) I hate talking on the phone, and she knows that. But she will call me many times, even after my husband tells her to send me an e-mail or a message on Facebook (ah, Facebook, another one of our battlefields lol), and when afterwards we meet in a family gathering, she will put me under the spotlight and ask me really loudly and in front of everyone why didn't I answer when she called. And then I look like the evil daughter-in-law, because everyone just loves her (except for her two daughter-in-laws so I know I'm not crazy or a bitch). She will make a point of saying that she really only wants to help, to be my friend, what's the problem in calling me?When she does something that annoys me, I try to hide my feelings so not to create an awkward situation but I don't always succeed. So what I do is I try to discreetly avoid her. That's when she senses I'm kinda mad at her and then she comes right up to my face and starts noticing everything that I'm wearing and saying ""what a nice blouse you're wearing"", ""what a beautiful necklace!"" (as if it was new, even though she's seen me wearing it it tens of time and even complimented it before), or she will show me something she bought and ask my opinion about it. And I can see in her face that she doesn't really want my opinion but to assess if I'm ok with her. I wish she would just apologize for whatever it is she did wrong, and leave me alone for a while instead of coming on so strong. Once I actually hid in the bathroom the escape the MIL probing eyes and when I was in there I heard her asking where I was. Oh, dear! LOLThere are many other things she does that annoy me, especially the way she is like a toddler when she doesn't get what she wants, and the fact that she inteprets every little thing people do or say as something else entirely. She also is a little paranoid and always thinks people are talking about her behind her back or judging her, even (and especially) her closest friends. I guess it comes from her low self-esteem. Honestly, I think she's a mess and could benefit greatly from therapy, but she's also religious and will have none of that. I wish my husband and I could move to a different location so we would see her less and maybe my relationship with her would improve.I also wish she was more mature and would not act like a kid.My question for you ESFPs is what can I do to try to improve my relationship with her as it is. She sometimes tells me that she loves me but I can't say it back to her. I don't really think I love her. But what can I do to assure her that yes, she's a good person, that she doesn't have to try so hard, etc? She is really needy (see HPD symptoms) and I have the worst time dealing with needy people. But I also can't tell her some things like I would with a friend, because she's so sensitive. I think she longs for me and her other DIL to see her as our second mother, since our own mothers live very far, and she's hurt when we gently say we don't see her like that. She wants to be our friend, but our personalities clash too much. So she wants to help, she wants to be a mother figure, but it has to be her way or she'll be hurt/offended. I find it very hard to deal with this situation and I would love to hear what you have to say about it. I'm open to answer any question you might have.I am not saying that I want her to completely change for my sake and behave the way I want. I just wish it wasn't always such a struggle. Maybe sometimes she could refrain from doing something that she knows I don't like, and next time I'll do something nice for her in gratitude. It's not like I don't know how to live with Es - both my husband and my dear sister are extroverts and I adore them, and we manage (have managed, in the case of my sister when we were growing up) to live together without killing each other LOL! So it's possible, unless INFJs and ESFPs are the two most incompatible types there are!I am also posting this on the INFJ forum, it will be interesting to hear what each type has to say. :)",INFJ in need of advice

So we've been dating for about 3-4 weeks. (We don't really have a ""bf/gf"" label yet).... And last night we were getting hot and heavy and I did something awkward - per usual - and he said ""It's ok, I love you""... And that took me super off-guard. We talked a little about it, and I told him I couldn't say it back yet. He admitted he said it too early. So my question is - is that common for ESFPs to say that too soon?

It was a brief one, got replaced quickly (he has the attention of a goldfish), and then flared up again after a period of time in which we hung out practically every day and had fun adventures. Now unfortunately, he said this lasted for an unordinarily long time (a year), and was hard to shake out of. He would keep hoping that I would reciprocate. Thus, he's cutting off ties to move on, among other reasons.So I have several questions. What on earth would an ESFP see in an INFJ??? He certainly has more attractive, more fun friends surrounding him, and I don't fit the type of the usual girls he likes, physically and personality-wise. Secondly, is there hope to be friends? Will he forgive and forget, and stop fearing a ""relapse""? Because I'm very optimistic and I think we can definitely keep our great friendship.Thanks ESFPs!",infj needing advice from you

1818,ESFP,"INTP male here.A couple weeks ago I started dating this ESFP. We're both seniors in high school but we've liked each other since junior year, so we already know each other on a friend basis. She was in an ill-fated relationship with this other guy (everything was against him) when we finally confessed to each other. She couldn't withhold her feelings, so she told him about me and he kinda just gave up on her and is still angry at her.We went on a date to the movies soon after. The next few days were weird. She seemed less interested in me. After a long talk with her, we decided to just be friends. The next few days we hung out and interacted with each other as if nothing had happened, like two very good friends that just like to chill with each other. She was going to the homecoming dance with our friend (girl), but the friend cancelled on her at the last minute. Now she (ESFP) just told me that they were going to ask me to join them yesterday, but they forgot. I agreed to go with her to the dance tonight, just the two of us.Being an INTP, it's natural for me to seek hidden meaning or motive behind every word and action, and I recognize that not everything has a hidden meaning. Help me judge how she feels about me based on the following and what I have already told you. I've been getting mixed signals here and I need your ESFP perspective on the situation. Here are some of the things she's told me, which might not actually reflect her own feelings and were just said to deal with things in the moment, such as excuses to just be friends. What do these statements say about her true feelings?   - she has feelings for me   - she has feelings for him (the guy she was ""dating"")   - he is mad at her because his ""pride is hurt""   - I'm too clingy (I'm not at all, but must have come off that way because my previous attempts at convincing her to stay with me implied an exaggerated a desire for long term commitment)   - she wants to save romanticisms (such as holding hands) for someone she's willing to commit too in the long term (""mr. right"")   - once suggested I should give this other girl that likes me a chance (I said I wasn't into her and she never mentioned it again)I really like this girl, just everything about her. But God I wish I could just read her mind. I want to be with her and make her happy. I fell that she wants to be with me too, but her feelings change a lot and can even conflict.

It just puts me through hell because one day the girl that I'm in love with is feeling things for me and its wonderful, but then at the drop of a pin somethings wrong and she is turned off by me and then things get complicated..and the contradicting, holy shit. She contradicts herself on so many things. I love all her flaws, but this is one that I have a hard time accepting. Especially when all of her contradicting thoughts are about how she feels about me.""I want to be with him""""I don't want to be with him""""I have feelings for him""""But I don't feel for him""""I don't want to lose him, but I don't want to be with him I don't think""AH, it just frustrates me even thinking about it. Before I'd get all hurt and depressed and upset. Even now when she starts saying things like ""I'm just done trying"" or ""this just needs to end"" it makes my stomach sink, but my main feelings are just ""Holy shit this is stupid and annoying, I'm not an item or a second option to you.""But neither of us can walk away. Whenever I get to that point where I feel like I can, something happens and I end up getting back into her. The ""way"" that I am that she likes, really only comes when I feel like she's into the relationship. Like shes committed or invested in a way. Or if I'm stressed out, or after an argument. I guess the shadow type for ESFP is INTJ, which she's drawn to. Idk. I'm sure you're all going to say just drop her and move on. I just needed to rant. But if you guys have any other advice on how to help her make up her mind I'd be more than happy to hear it.TL;DR: I'm in love with an ISFP that doesn't know what she wants, or how to feel about me and its been going on for 7 months.

1844,ESFP,"Hi. I am currently in a phase of self-discovery. I have recently discovered that I am ESFP and was able to come to terms with things I am unhappy about. I am a first year psychology and computer science student.I entered the university with a low expectation of myself - in many ways - as I had rather unhappy time in high school. In high school, I did terribly in my study, partially because I was not happy, but mostly because I am not very good at sticking with plans and pushing myself when I could go out and watch a movie or dedicate my time in practicing for the musical that I had a lead in.Even though I want to use this oppertunity further educate myself and become a better individual in general, since studying has never been a strong suit for me, I am facing the same situation as I did in high school, where I am not studying because I've never really done it properly.According to ESFP description, we are not very good with academic stuff because we are more interested in being in attention and pleasure, and generally just not logical or persistent.Maybe I am giving the test too much credit. However, most things described in the ESFP page was true to me. And I want to know if any ESFP was able to really push themselves academically, and if so, how they did it. If you have any study experience as ESFP, please share it here for me. I just want to know what other ESFP has done.",Studying as ESFP
1845,ESFP,"I'm an introvert, but I've pushed myself and become more ambiverted over the last couple of years. I willingly engage myself in more social activities, because it's not that I don't like to talk to people, I just don't like to talk to people about things that aren't interesting or stimulating (to me). I'm a very deep thinker and I find if I can have really deep, intellectual/philosophical conversations, they actually kind of re-energize me, but if someone wants to tell me about what happened on any given reality TV show the night before, zzzzzzzzzz. That's not to say that all extraverts are shallow, I know this isn't true, I *am* curious how many extraverts also like deep, stimulating conversation, or if it's more just a sense of connecting/relating to someone, regardless of the subject matter?Anyways, some weeks, there are events almost every night after work that I would like to go to, but I have a limit, and this can be frustrating especially when say there are 4 events and 2 of them I'm not sure how taxing they will be so I don't want to go, not enjoy it as much as I thought I might, and then be too tired the next night for something I really do want to go to.I thought to myself the other day ""man, Extraverts must be like the energizer bunny, they can go out every night and have fun and almost never have to worry about their battery running out"".But I know there's more to it than that. So, what are your limits, what tires you out and do you actually like going out all the time?Thanks in advance for the insight :)","INFJ here, I have an extraversion question"

1847,ESFP,"So I'm a mellow ass guy, I'm happy to take bull shit if it means avoiding confrontation (something I'm currently working to change), but my anger always seems to come out in a sharp, intense burst which last no more thant a second or two. But by then the damage is usually done, I just launch shit at walls or at other shit (Never at people) but the ammount of holes in my walls is just stupid. So, do I have anger problems?

1848,ESFP,"I'm new to this site and personality typing so excuse my general noobiness, but I don't recall reading anywhere relating to ESFP's avoiding confrontation or letting things slide when they really shouldn't. I do know that a lot of us find we aren't taken seriously though, which might be related. I'm just wondering if this is more prominent in myself, being a little under confident as a person, but I just hate the idea of upsetting people or feeling as though they'll dislike me for solidifying my point and rejecting what they're doing, even though rationally I know I take bullshit all the time and I dont dislike that person because of that... So yeah, anyone get what I'm on about?? :)",Are ESFP's non-confrontational or 'Push overs'?

1851,ESFP,"I am an ISFJ girl who is totally into an ESFP (I'm 90% sure that's what he is) but I have no idea how to get him into me. I already know that he thinks I'm attractive, but I want to avoid the whole 'hit it and quit it' thing because from what I've gathered, he can lose interest easily. I'd like to attract him for longer than just a few weeks. He is always incredibly busy and I'd like to become a higher priority if possible. So my questions are: * What gets you ESFPs going?* What are ideal dates?* Which behaviours do you like to see from ideal mates?* What things do you absolutely love/hate in potential partners?* How can I make you like me more than just eye candy?",How can I date you?
1852,ESFP,"I'm an INTJ programmer, and my roommate is an ESFP artist. I'm helping her with her required programming class. As you might imagine, it has been quite a struggle for her to grasp the highly abstract nature of programming. It also doesn't help that this is one of her last classes. She is very burned out by college, and her primary worry is on finding employment, and not on her last classes.Despite this, when I come to help her, she will be very attentive, and try her hardest to understand what is going on. Of course I'm not expecting her to become a pro at this, but I do want to do what I can to help her as much as I can since she is struggling A LOT.The main issue I see is that most of the time she can understand very simple concepts by themselves, but only in a very specific circumstance, and fail to learn the pattern and reason behind that concept. To put it in more concrete terms (and ridiculously simplified example): she will understand that ""2 + 2 = 4"" after seeing an example of 4 things together, but afterwards, when ask to put the sumation of 2 and 3, she will be lost, and unable to relate that to the prevous example.I hope I expressed my problem clearly.

One thing I admire about him is that I know he will have no regrets on his death bed as he is certainly living a full life of adventure/pleasure/fun.
