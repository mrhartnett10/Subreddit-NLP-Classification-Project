10,1,"So, as we know, ESFP's are kind of known for living in the moment, maybe even a little too much. I don't know if you guys feel this way, and it's kind of pathetic to admit, but my ""living in the present"" is very extreme. Particularly if I'm going through something regarding physical pain. Every time I'm sick, or feel unwell, or get hurt, I constantly have to repeat in my head ""There will be a time and a place when I won't feel like this"" over and over again, because it seems like an impossible task to comprehend the fact that this pain won't last forever. I know it sounds stupid, but it's genuinely what I do. It's not always a bad thing, when something good is happening, I'm truly just there soaking up every wonderful moment of whatever it is. It's just when it's something bad, my mind has a hard time realizing that this pain is only temporary. I don't know, does any of that make sense to my fellow ESFP's? How do non-ESFP's feel?

A few example of the best and top ESFP Anime characters on the top of my head are Kuwabara from Yu Yu Hakusho, Brook from One Piece, Majin Buu from DBZ, Knuckle Bine from Hunter x Hunter, and know Ryuji from Persona 5 for video games.My ESFP Anime Characters list last year:[https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFP/comments/hin2mv/esfp\_anime\_characters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFP/comments/hin2mv/esfp_anime_characters/)My ENFP Characters list in comparison since their similar:[https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/hdakhy/enfp\_anime\_characters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/hdakhy/enfp_anime_characters/)But besides anime, what are some great fictional ESFP characters from Live Action series? Tell me a list of some great live action ones, western cartoons and movies and TV shows, and video games even is fine. Often times people get confused a lot between ENFPs and ESFPs and mix up characters a lot which causes debates like with the common ENFP shonen main characters. In my opinion lots of learning of the functions and behaviors I learned a lot of the differences between the two types so I trust my judgement on telling ENFP and ESFP characters apart. So I disagree with an opinion on this common confusion and think a ENFP character is getting confused as ESFP I'll share my opinion on it and explain there Ne and Si they use for evidence.As a good example of my opinion on this for characters. I type Princess Jasmine ESFP from Alladin and I type Ariel ENFP from the Little Mermaid for instance and comparison there. Theres quite a lot ENFPs and NFs in Disney movies which fits the Disney magic vibe and idealism the company shows and imagination and so on. Most people know Disney's image and how it is so I don't need to explain this. As another example, I type Ty Lee ESFP from Avatar and type Aang ENFP for more contrast there. I type Simba ENFP, I type Goofy ESFP regular and from Kingdom Hearts as well. Kirishima is ESFP from My Hero Academia also.Tell me some examples of some ESFP live action characters in movies and TV shows, games, and western cartoons and movies too, mostly live action I'm looking for though since I watch a lot of animation and know most famous animated characters types already so the live action side I'm interested in moreso for this future post I'm gonna make for ESFP characters in other medium. Thanks for all the help.","Tell Me Some Live Action Fictional ESFPs, Western Cartoons and Movies and More, No Anime Cause I Did Those Already",i m working on another post for fictional character type of each of the 16 type i already did one for anime character and the other type a well i ll post my list of the best anime character down below if your interested a few example of the best and top anime character on the top of my head are kuwabara from yu yu hakusho brook from one piece majin buu from dbz knuckle bine from hunter x hunter and know ryuji from persona 5 for video game my anime character list last year,476,95,0.0,0.159,0.841,0.9413

69,1,"I believe ESFPs do not get enough love online, so I, an INFJ, am here to express my appreciation for them. (I only know two ESFPs in real life, one is my best girl friend and another is a older peer I really admire, so I have had positive experiences with this type).1. I am just so IN LOVE with your go-getter attitude and work ethic.- The ESFPs I know do not wait for good things to come to them, they work and grind for what they want. Whether it's for their dream grad school, their dream job, or someone they want to be with, they make concrete steps in moment to push themselves closer to that goal.2. You guys are such a joy and wild child at parties and in general- The stereotype is that ESFPs are partiers, but it's not emphasized enough how TRULY fun they are when it's time to let loose. As an introvert, I really loved having a friend that I could go out with and feel comfortable to go wild with. They're great dancers and singers, and generally know how to have a good time and a few laughs.3. Great listeners!- If you're in a conversation with an ESFP, they hear and actively listen to what you say. I always felt heard, and comfortable talking to them, because I know they will actually consider what I say.4. Underrated wisdom and advice- That said, I feel ESFPs are underrated with how actually wise they are. Sure in some situations, they may screw up a bit or not really see the underlying issue. But for an INFJ, their take-aways on life and their own philosophies are extremely beneficial to anxious and melancholic Ni Doms.5. Amazing style and eye for aesthetics- Fashion icons, great taste, modern but not boring6. Great bodies and admirable commitment to exercise- Only reason I am comfortable enough messing around in the gym is because of my ESFP best friend. Pushed me to stick to a routine, look exercises up, and in general just have fun with moving.7. Extremely smart and competent at their field of choice- Also not talked about enough, but the ESFPs I know are /experts/ at in what they choose to do. They have a structured knowledge on the subject, and are able to act from there. On top of their consistent energy for work, there is not much they cannot do.8. Surprisingly non-conventional- I feel almost guilty for thinking this, but at first glance I judged them to be very basic. But just because they were very peppy and knew how to navigate people/life, does not mean they are any less unique. Their interests and life paths are not so typical, and they have a very unique mind.9. EXTREMELY loyal to their family, close friends, and significant other- ESFPs get a lot of flack for cheating and being drawn to others because they're just so attractive and smooth, but these people are COMMITTED when they're committed. They also stand by their closest friends, and stick to their families.10. Literally the most generous people- I am always eating, wearing, or using things my ESFPs have offered to me. They never see it as transactional, its just generosity for generosity's sake.11. Unexpectedly amazing leaders for their communities- When their people skills are combined with their knowledge on how things work, they are able to guide, lead, and organize the general public for greater goals.12. Very relaxed about differences- Literally so chill about other people's quirks, unless it crosses a boundary or value they hold close to their heart13. Exceptionally observant- Ni Doms SUCK at this so much, idk why it's a stereotype that INFJs can read people well (maybe if we know the person or place like the back of our hand). But ESFPs are so skilled at noting tiny variations in a person's behavior, able to read if they're angry, nervous, or in love. It's always my ESFP that's reading me or reading for me.14. Very confident, yet humble and modest- They know they're worth and they are not afraid to work for what they want, but they never have an air of arrogance or excessive pride.15. Just great people overall- Happy or sad, rain or shine, just wonderful people to hang out and bond with. Good vibes and great friends only gang :)",Some Love for ESFPs,i believe s do not get enough love online so i an infj am here to express my appreciation for them i only know two s in real life one is my best girl friend and another is a older peer i really admire so i have had positive experience with this type 1 i am just so in love with your go getter attitude and work ethic the s i know do not wait for good thing to come to them they work and grind for what they want whether it s for their dream grad school their dream job or someone they want to be with they make concrete step in moment to push themselves closer to that goal 2 you guy are such a joy and wild child at party and in general the stereotype is that s are partiers but it s not emphasized enough how truly fun they are when it s time to let loose a an introvert i really loved having a friend that i could go out with and feel comfortable to go wild with they re great dancer and singer and generally know how to have a good time and a few laugh 3 great listener if you re in a conversation with an they hear and actively listen to what you say i always felt heard and comfortable talking to them because i know they will actually consider what i say 4 underrated wisdom and advice that said i feel s are underrated with how actually wise they are sure in some situation they may screw up a bit or not really see the underlying issue but for an infj their take aways on life and their own philosophy are extremely beneficial to anxious and melancholic ni doms 5 amazing style and eye for aesthetic fashion icon great taste modern but not boring6 great body and admirable commitment to exercise only reason i am comfortable enough messing around in the gym is because of my best friend pushed me to stick to a routine look exercise up and in general just have fun with moving 7 extremely smart and competent at their field of choice also not talked about enough but the s i know are expert at in what they choose to do they have a structured knowledge on the subject and are able to act from there on top of their consistent energy for work there is not much they cannot do 8 surprisingly non conventional i feel almost guilty for this but at first glance i judged them to be very basic but just because they were very peppy and knew how to navigate people life doe not mean they are any le unique their interest and life path are not so typical and they have a very unique mind 9 extremely loyal to their family close friend and significant other s get a lot of flack for cheating and being drawn to others because they re just so attractive and smooth but these people are committed when they re committed they also stand by their closest friend and stick to their family 10 literally the most generous people i am always eating wearing or using thing my s have offered to me they never see it a transactional it just generosity for generosity s sake 11 unexpectedly amazing leader for their community when their people skill are combined with their knowledge on how thing work they are able to guide lead and organize the general public for greater goal 12 very relaxed about difference literally so chill about other people s quirk unless it cross a boundary or value they hold close to their heart13 exceptionally observant ni doms suck at this so much idk why it s a stereotype that infjs can read people well maybe if we know the person or place like the back of our hand but s are so skilled at noting tiny variation in a person s behavior able to read if they re angry nervous or in love it s always my that s reading me or reading for me 14 very confident yet humble and modest they know they re worth and they are not afraid to work for what they want but they never have an air of arrogance or excessive pride 15 just great people overall happy or sad rain or shine just wonderful people to hang out and bond with good vibe and great friend only gang some love for s,3888,756,0.055,0.263,0.681,0.9997

86,1,"Hey guys! I can't decide between ESFP and ESTP cause I really can't decide between Feeling and Thinking, it's a very close tie. I already posted the same text on ESTP Teddit but I would really appreciate it, if you can spend some time reading random facts about me and say of it sounds like you. Thanks in advance üòä‚ô• Oh and sorry for any mistakes, english isn't my first language - I am a very open person, make friends very easily, can socialise with everyone, but prefer to talk to my friends at parties because all smalltalks are the same and dumb- I am a very emotional and sensitive person, but I don't like to talk about my feelings, I keep my face in public - I am not very empathic, it's difficult for me to provide emotional support cause I prefer to solve the problem instead. But I cry watching almost every movie because of the sad music or I can cry because my new plant is dead. - I hate people who have to think for too long while deciding on smth, to discuss the same thing over and over again, cause I prefer to quickly make a decision and act and I don't care if this is the best one or not- I am impatient and restless, if I doesn't understand something right away, then I drop the case. Especially if it's about understanding some complicated theories (I work in sciences so I have to read a lot of theoretical stuff)  - I am good at solving problems of other people, I can remain calm in a stressful situation- I can be rude unconsciously, I try to act friendly and nice towards everyone but it happens sometimes. If I know that I have offended someone, this worries me a lot (exception: I don't like this person, then I don't care lol) - My opinion about my own morality depends on someone else's assessment, if I receive negative feedback and criticism, I consider myself as a bad person and can fall into tears. It's also very easy to manipulate me by making me feel bad, it's hard to say ""no"" in that cases- I can't stand people trying to show how special and individualistic they are.   - I try to be tolerant and accept any point of view, even if it contradicts my principles and logic.  I think that everything on this planet is very subjective, so even if something is the dumbest thing in my eyes, everyone has a right on their own opinion- But this doesn't stop me from provoking  discussions just by taking sides with some very controversial opinions. I just enjoy arguing (although I am not good at it and I am a bad looser who gets emotional)  - I don't believe in mysticism and spiritual things, but I think a lot about the meaning of life and purpose of humanity- I dislike breaking rules and make sure others don't break them too- I am NOT into any sports, it's just too exhausting. I don't like risks and anything ""extreme"".

95,1,"Hey! Sorry if these questions have been answered a thousand times, I'm fairly new to mbti and haven't engaged much with the community. I know that 16p mistypes people often but I'm not that deep to know which types and to what so I'm wondering if ESFPs getting ENFP is a common occurrence.The thing is I'm trying to type my sister who had only really taken 16p before (several times, always the same result, ENFP) and just trusted it as the description there seemed to fit her. However, I had my suspicions she had been mistyped because I thought she was too down to earth and practical to be an intuitive, so I helped her figure out her type through the cognitive functions instead. Turns out she's probably an ESFP, with the most defining factor being that her Se is pretty strong as opposed to Si. For example, she's very good at noticing details in her environment and reading people. Besides, she admitted to not feel very strongly towards Ne, even if Ni didn't cause much of a reaction either (which, if it's used as an inferior function, could make sense)The problem is that she doesn't relate as much to most ESFP definitions because they seem ""too exaggerated"" for her, especially the part about being super outgoing, fun-loving and such. I still think she might be one and that her reluctance is due to the fact that she's actually a bit of an ambivert and almost shy. Any ESFP here feels the same way? Most of the other stuff is spot on for her, but a lot of ExFP characteristics are similar so it could go both ways tbh.The second part of the question is that I couldn't help but notice that ESFPs and INTPs (my own type) are pretty much opposites when it comes to functions and I found it really amusing. I always thought we get along pretty well despite our differences in key moments (maybe she gets irritated when I get too logical or sidetracked, maybe I find her too impulsive sometimes, that's about all of it), but I assume it's a tough combination when it doesn't involve people literally raised together. Do you find us annoying in general or it's not that bad?","Possible ESFP mistyped as ENFP in 16 Personalities, what do you think?

118,1,o there are two concepts I've had in my head. One was creating a discord server with all 16 types (my own idea and I've not seen somebody else do this before me)Create a youtube channel with either all XNTX types or to be different all XNXP types. So I just have this thought what if we combine them and have a youtube channel with 16 types. This would mean a balanced perspective from all the types. Types like ESTJ ISTJ  and ESFP will achually get recognised for once as most mbti YouTube channels are just run by INXP or INXJs or at most ENXPs. It will be intresting to see how the 16 types work together setting up the foundations off the channel Different types will take on different role while setting it up. This dosnt mean IXFP cant be a leader or a Perciever can organise the channel but I think there are different roles that will suit different type better. All types will be on at some point especially when we are making a video about that specific type or that group off type however only some not sure how many will for videos not related for a certain type. We will probably have a discord invent new typing methods and build a website in the futureI'd prefer most people on it to be 15-18 so please tell me your age.

She was rebellious, doing things like stealing fruits from neighbors and sneaking out of the home to hang out with friends.¬∑ Friendly, charming, easygoing, energetic, funny, playful, cheerful, childish, outgoing, flamboyant, positive, and far from a serious person¬∑ A few things she judges and hates most in people are those who are lazy and weak. She often says she can‚Äôt stand pushovers because people should just be straight-up about things they don‚Äôt like. ¬∑ She‚Äôs good with her hands and has a lot of skills in things like sewing and cooking.

She also jumps to conclusions quickly.¬∑ She‚Äôs saving with money because she stresses the importance of having to save for the future and for emergency situations. Financial security is important to her. She always talks about how her children must plan for their future to be successful.¬∑ Despite telling children they have to plan for their future, she‚Äôs not much of a planner herself. ¬∑ She doesn‚Äôt typically follow rules and prefers to do things her own way. Even with cooking, she doesn‚Äôt listen to recipes even though she enjoys cooking up new dishes. She never gives an estimate of time because she claims ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no such time‚Äù and she enjoys making things by her own ‚Äúideas‚Äù.¬∑ She doesn‚Äôt care much to tell other people what to do; however, she‚Äôs extremely controlling when it comes to her children and has an issue if they don‚Äôt do things her way.¬∑ Tends to do things really quickly, is impatient, always loses family‚Äôs possessions, and frequently misplaces items. ¬∑ Can be quite insensitive and blunt. She‚Äôs also not understanding of people who are driven by emotions and can‚Äôt relate to them.¬∑ Although she can‚Äôt stand people who do things using their emotions, she can also be dramatic.

142,1,"So I‚Äôm wondering if y‚Äôall can relate. I started to think about this a lot since getting out of an unhealthy relationship. So I care a lot about how I look (maybe too much sometimes) and naturally put a lot of effort into my image. Beauty and aesthetics have always been very important to me, which I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall can understand! Anyway, I do want people to be attracted to me physically, appreciate my style, etc. However, when I start to hear too much of the same message, it starts to give me anxiety that people are only valuing me on a surface level. My ex and I were dating long distance for 8 months. When visiting her, I was continuing to be introduced to more and more of her friends. This was interesting. Nothing ever went too deep with them, but our conversations were engaging, and I always felt like I‚Äôd made a good impression. Long story short, while texting my ex one night, she told me that her friends had been calling me ‚Äúhot (my name)‚Äù, which she apparently had no involvement in. My ex would also compliment me a lot on my looks, very seldom about my character.

239,1,"Productivity can often be over complicated. When in fact, the most efficient productivity approaches are super simple. There are very few methods as simple and effective as the Ivy Lee Method, which is over 100 years old. It‚Äôs essentially a 5 step process that looks like this:1. At the end of each day, write down the 6 most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow2. Prioritize the 6 items in order of true importance3. The next day, concentrate only on the first task until completed. Then, move the next task.4. Work your way through your list. Any unfinished items move on to the next day with a new list of 6 tasks.5. Repeat this process each working daySo often our propensity for following some elaborate technique can inhibit our ability to be truly productive. This method simply relies on creating a to-do list with a fixed number of items and approaching it in a smart way.

262,1,"No matter how I looked at my past, there Always was in me this deep hate for the utter simpleness of my peers hapiness. They could laugh 10 min and make jokes about how the teacher missed 1 stair  going to class. And I was Always cynical about it. There was Always this voice saying : ""That's so stupid, it's not even funny and it's been 10minute. STFU already and work on your exercizes or you'll complain again how you didn't passed but spent all class laughing about a stupid joke"".I refused to be happy because I thought it would make me stupid. And yes I wasn't, I was Always a Straight A student. But I became bitter about people over time, bitter at how happy they were and how little they did to improve when I percieved myself as being the ""hero"" by ""sacrificing"" his happiness to be the best. I was a hard working person taking pride in my results but also in my .... unhappiness ??? I was happy that I wasn't happy because I made the association that being unhappy was a sign of hard work. Hard working people are working this hard because they're unhappy about their situation and doing everything they Can to better it. I assumed that because when people's life is on the Line they took thing more seriously, I should engineer my life to make it seem like m'y life was on the line 24/7 and work as hard as I could to better my situation.This came from a lot of observations of my peers. In fact I realized that most straight A students were like me. They weren't happy in the now but planning their life overtime and making sacrifices. The only difference is that they took it to a bearable level, when I was applying to basically all my life. I had so much hatred and jealousy I guess. So much anger that everyone around me was happy but I wasn't. So angry that even thought I was working my hardest, life didn't improve. In fact it was getting worse and worse over time.I was an anti-conformists and had so much anger that I was scared by myself. I treated myself badly for wanting happiness and I was highly judgemental. On the outside I was just a cool dude very laid back who wasn't very demanding about friendship. I appeared wise and deep and smart on first looks. Someone with his priorities in life who's very reliable, not emotionaly draining, chill. But when people were getting closer to me, they started to realize that it wasn't the case, it was all appearance, but I was clueless like they were, if not more clueless than them.When I realized that friendship led to delusion I refused to socialize, refusing to let people get close to me. I wanted to maintain this appearance of thoughtfullness because it flattered my ego. For once I was recognized for my smartness, my knowledge. Even thought I had the emotional maturity of a toddler from not socializing and refusing hapiness.People came to me because I seemed happy, seemed like I had it all figured it out and I could maybe share my secret to find personal happiness. And I took pride in it so I entertained the myth. But this kept me from actually wisening up. Having my opinions changed and experiecing life. I was coming from a position of superiority when I was equal to my peers.Eventually, my peers experienced life when I was pretending, and now I'm too ashamed to admit that I was the stupid one all along.So I bottle up untill I Land my master's degree  and leave the house and the close Friends and go on vacations to catch up. Allow myself to be happy for once and Come back energized and enthusiastic with ""true"" life experiences.This realization was made thanks to my ESFP friend. Because ESFP place a lot of importance on protecting ""good vibes"". ESFP's friend sayings :Treating yourself badly will make you treat people close to you badly.You're more likely to treat yourself badly when you're in a Bad place. Thus you're more likely to be an asshole toward close people when in a Bad place.TL;DR : Be happy and you'll be naturally be nice to everyone around you. You won't expect a dime from your kind gestures and people will love how good you are to them. With one exception for love, were your SO's happiness is more important than yours.when I was in this phase i Saw it as a threat to my work ethics, but didn't realized at the Time that it made me bitter and a Bad person. Didn't made me realize that I was becoming an asshole and snobby to my Friends (except him whom I Always kept in high regards. I Always felt like his equal so my attitude never took a toll on our relationships thankfully)I didn't realized that it kept me from experiencing love with the opposite sex and to experience life. I thought it was a necessary sacrifice but it wasn't.I think a good explanation behind it was my upbringing. I was brought by muslims parents with 80% of Muslim Friends. I went to Muslim School from 6 to 16 years old, do the ramadan and went to mosquee every friday. I was CONSTANTLY told that everything we do in this World will have an impact on our futur life. Wether we will go to heaven or hell. We should Always think about next life and keep ourselves from temporary pleasures (sins on earth) to find eternal happiness in heaven. We never really talked about it because our Muslim School was mixed, we had girls and boys. But sex was evil. It was a taboo, but we all knew that we shouldn't have girlfriends/boyfriends. Those are only for the non believers. And we shouldn't have sex as well untill marriage. We couldn't behave like non believers and take examples in their lifestyles because they didn't know the ""truth"" and were sinners. We could make friendship with them but it shouldn't affect our faith. since I Always was a good student, I took pride in my faith and my dedication again. But even student of said School were not involved in their beliefs. They had this sort of double life were at Muslim school they were believers but outside they weren't. Wherease I was committed in my lifestyle all the way through. Thankfully I had many Muslim Friends in my neighbourhood but again they all had this half-in half-out lifestyle. It was hard to keep up and there were so much contradictions. Like they would go to the mosquee with me Friday morning and do one night stands and party with alcohol and stuff the night. I get it thought. Not everyone is perfect and everyone has flaws, but being this blatantly inconsistent should somewhat distrub you. Because it sure did distrubed me.To this day I'm still Lost. But part of me think is because I live in this inconsistent settings. There are no rules, no consistency. This makes it very difficult to see the benefits but very easy to see the disadvantages. I can't party and have a girlfriend but I can't also have Muslim Friends my age outside of mosquee because I'm not ""cool"", I don't go out and party.The biggest one is having this distance beetween Muslim and non Muslim. I thought of religion as a communitary thing but it's highly divisive.Same with teachers that praises hard work and good attitude in class when your peers condemn focus and dedication. I Guess you have to be in the middle. Happy but hardworking as well",INTP best Friend with ESFP - Topic of discussion : Instant gratification or Better futur results ?,no matter how i looked at my past there always wa in me this deep hate for the utter simpleness of my peer hapiness they could laugh 10 min and make joke about how the teacher missed 1 stair going to class and i wa always cynical about it there wa always this voice saying that s so stupid it s not even funny and it s been 10minute stfu already and work on your exercizes or you ll complain again how you didn t passed but spent all class laughing about a stupid joke i refused to be happy because i thought it would make me stupid and yes i wasn t i wa always a straight a student but i became bitter about people over time bitter at how happy they were and how little they did to improve when i percieved myself a being the hero by sacrificing his happiness to be the best i wa a hard working person taking pride in my result but also in my unhappiness i wa happy that i wasn t happy because i made the association that being unhappy wa a sign of hard work hard working people are working this hard because they re unhappy about their situation and doing everything they can to better it i assumed that because when people s life is on the line they took thing more seriously i should engineer my life to make it seem like m y life wa on the line 24 7 and work a hard a i could to better my situation this came from a lot of observation of my peer in fact i realized that most straight a student were like me they weren t happy in the now but planning their life overtime and making sacrifice the only difference is that they took it to a bearable level when i wa applying to basically all my life i had so much hatred and jealousy i guess so much anger that everyone around me wa happy but i wasn t so angry that even thought i wa working my hardest life didn t improve in fact it wa getting worse and worse over time i wa an anti conformist and had so much anger that i wa scared by myself i treated myself badly for wanting happiness and i wa highly al on the outside i wa just a cool dude very laid back who wasn t very demanding about

276,1,"It‚Äôs no secret that habit building can be hard. I‚Äôm constantly experimenting with ways to make adoption of better habits a little more seamless for myself. And then, I was introduced to a concept called habit stacking.Habit Stacking follows the principle that it‚Äôs always easier to practice new habits by attaching them to the tail-end of an existing one. This is formula that you have to bear in mind:After \[CURRENT HABIT\],I will \[NEW Habit\]You‚Äôre essentially taking your willpower out of the equation by following a routine of practices, and can even have stacks on top of stack, If you prefer. It leveraged the power of using a routine to add on new habits and follow it through muscle memory. For example:After I wake up in the morning, I meditate for 15 minute.After I meditate for 15 minutes, I workout for an hour.After I workout for an hour, I handle email and other tasks.This has even been discussed by James Clear in his bestseller *Atomic Habits* and explains that this is a great way of tapping into the way that our neurons and brain in programmed.

Some of you may have already heard of it (and know that our first version was actually barely usable). I wanted to let you know about it because we've made a lot of improvements since then and thought you'd be interested in trying it out.Like many of us, we're hardcore MBTI lovers and enthusiasts and thought it strange that no MBTI app existed yet. We thought MBTI could fix a few problems with current dating apps.For one, you are recommended people you‚Äôre statistically likely to love and understand effortlessly, instead of being forced to meet every single type of person. Second, you can save time, money, and emotional fatigue you would have spent on bad dates with no chemistry on other dating apps. Third, you can deeply understand each other‚Äôs personalities before you meet and in a way that was never possible before. And fourth, get in-depth dating advice and insight into how to attract and get along with anyone.[Boo Telepathy Demo](https://i.redd.it/byg6ef7scvs51.gif)Many of our users are using the app to make friends and foster deeper, more meaningful connections. We pretty much built this app for people like us, so I'd love to get your feedback on how we can make it better.The app is completely free to use, with added features like Dating Telepathy that are part of a premium membership (to support our operations).You can download the app through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store links on our website: [https://boo.dating](https://boo.dating/)Thanks!

In fact, your habits can be completely hacked once you understand the stages of their formation. This can be explained by using Charles Duhigg‚Äôs Habit LoopThe Habit Loop is a neurological loop that governs our habits and comprises of 3 stages:* Cue: This is the initial trigger for the habit. It can be a location, time, emotional state, etc.* Routine: The behavior you wish to change or reinforce.* Reward: The aftermath of the routine that causes to to revisit that habit in the future.Through my experience, I‚Äôve learnt that it‚Äôs most effective to stick with the same cue and reward and simply manipulate the routine to produce the same result.The key is to really pay attention to the cues that cause you to engage in the habit and then see if you can get the same reward by altering your routine for a better one.

368,1,"Mario is like the best ESFP character ever, he lives in the moment and responds to details around him. He's very spontaneous and impulsive and confident and follows her inner values and heart and emotions inside with his aux Fi. His Te ter helps him get the job done and he's not overly future oriented at all with his low Ni inferior and doesn't read between the lines very much. He's very hands on with his dom Se and is a plumber and loves to jump and perform in front of people. Details and responding to him with his jumps is everything to Mario, Se doesn't mean you love physical activity. Any type can do and love that, Ne users too love and are great at sports. Princess Daisy is a ENFP. But Mario is the best ESFP character, I'm saying this in celebration of the awesome Super Mario Bros 3D All Stars Collection that just came out. I just got my copy and pre-order in the mail yesterday and I've been loving it so far. I got Mario Sunshine up in the background right now and am playing it now. Its the first time Mario Sunshine has been rereleased so I'm enjoying every minute of it, this game is my childhood even if its not the best and isn't my fav Mario game anymore, that spot goes to Mario Odyssey now and Mario 64 and Mario Bros 3.

372,1,"The Se function, while having the letter ""E"",  simply means having a proactive attitude towards seeking qualities of experience and information in the world.  It has nothing to do with being socially outgoing or being an 'extrovert' in the colloquial sense (recharging around others). Too many people conflate ""extroverted sensing"" or ""E"" with ""extrovert"" and call it a day. I'd imagine many people shy away from considering ESFP as their type due to the stereotypes and this idea that introverts can't be ESFP or that ESFPs don't like abstract thinking because Ni is repressed (false).   The fact is, there are many variants of ESFP and some of these can be quite heavy in Fi or Ni. ESFP represents Gamma first and foremost (the best quadra!), with Pe being our primary function (exploration). We share similar values and themes with Gammas, and share our mode of operation with the other ExxPs. But socially we can be anything, an extrovert or an introvert.","The letter ""E"" does not mean 'extrovert'",the se function while having the letter e simply mean having a proactive attitude towards seeking quality of experience and information in the world it ha nothing to do with being socially outgoing or being an extrovert in the colloquial sense recharging around others too many people conflate extroverted or e with extrovert and call it a day i d imagine many people shy away from considering a their type due to the stereotype and this idea that introvert can t be or that s don t like abstract because ni is repressed false the fact is there are many variant of and some of these can be quite heavy in fi or ni represents gamma first and foremost the best quadra with pe being our primary function exploration we share similar value and theme with gamma and share our mode of operation with the other exxps but socially we can be anything an extrovert or an introvert the letter e doe not mean extrovert,906,165,0.028,0.092,0.881,0.7964

So idk I thought I‚Äôd write what Si/Fe/Ti/Ne evoke to me.Do y‚Äôall relate to the following?- Nemesis: Si = I can‚Äôt stand traditional people who won‚Äôt budge or deviate from what they know, their routine, the whole deal. The kind that don‚Äôt wanna take risks, leave their comfort zone etc. What‚Äôs a comfort zone anyway? So yeah I tend to have a conflicting relationship with strong Si users. I guess that‚Äôs my definition of a nemesis- Critic: Fe = good old folks who wanna tell me how I should feel about things.

392,1,"I‚Äôm not too sure if I‚Äôm an ESFP or an ENFP because I find that I exhibit characteristics of both  1. I am not aware of my surroundings much at all and often do end up being lost in my thoughts and becoming easily distracted. Also while I am terrible at remembering names I am good at detecting changes in people (e.g new haircut etc) 2. I am really good at understanding people and their motives but I usually do it by reading their body language with some speculation mixed in. 3. I have really good reflexes but have poor hand eye coordination. I usually find that I‚Äôm one of the first to react to a scenario but would not be first choice on a sports team. I‚Äôm also quite clumsy and always found voice acting easier than regular drama because I‚Äôm not too good at moving on stage 4. I am somewhat practical - I don‚Äôt like discussing philosophy for a long time because I don‚Äôt see the point (though I‚Äôm sure there is one) of going on for hours about something that doesn‚Äôt have an answer or help me in my daily life but am happy to have the occasional conversation. I think I enjoy small talk but more importantly I love understanding what makes people tick, especially the closed off ones! I also love murder mysteries :) I find that my sister (ISFJ) is much more practical and grounded than I am but I do often find my NT friends to not really be that in touch with reality, actual practical reality. I did get really friendly with one INFJ guy, and omg trying to understand him was equal parts amazing and frustrating. I felt he was so much more idealistic than me, he looked at the world, saw that it was shit but still wanted it to be better. Whereas I look at the world, see that it‚Äôs shit and go OK, but here are it‚Äôs good parts and opportunities, how can I take advantage of that? My point being that, I‚Äôm not too sure if I lean more towards the intuition or sensing side. I also have an ENFP male friend, who I felt also had a lot of pie in the sky ideas and grand perceptions of himself but I felt reality was quite different and is follow through was a bit weak. 5. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself to be highly fashionable and for the longest time, I didn‚Äôt even care much about my appearance. It was only once I started working in corporate I realised the importance of dressing well, particularly in client facing roles so I‚Äôve been putting in a bit more effort but I‚Äôve still got a loooong way to go.

395,1," Hello guys, I'm recently being stuck between ISFP or ESFP, as both types are very similar to each other, it makes it hard to distunguish whether if I use Te more or Ni more. Both Fi and Se can be effectivly under strong use both in either Dominant and Auxiliary position and sometimes It's very easy confuse.  So I want to know if you guys relate to this description;  to escape stress, I indulge myself in activities that connecte me to reality, such as going outside to the nature or beach, trying to immerse myself in a fun and interesting activity, and overall relaxing or trying find a time to enjoy tasty food at the Restaurant.  I would love to learn to assert myself more efficiently, without appearing childishly stupid to others, in a way that would draw inspiration to others, rather. I wish people would appreciate me, instead of telling me off to ""Grow up"", which I take offense in this, because it always makes me feel like I am not perfect to others for oblivious reason.  I overall fear the future, I do not want to approach the future, mainly because I dont want to age up and become old, losing my physicality, my young beauty, and ability to experience being in the moment to the fullest. I overall hate thinking about the future, and most of the time I just feel nostalgia to the past, but always and foremost, my importance is to embrace living in the moment, being lively, enjoy beauty, nature, the lively atmosphere in cities, competition, being with your friend(s), cool activities, afterall, this is what only matters to me.  Unfortunately, I dont leave th house often, because I dont have much social activities available to me to go to that would entertain me. I usualy go outside like 2 or 3 times per week for 2 hours around to enjoy those listed activties I previously mentioned, and thats all, unfortunately I'm not a fan of just going outside mindlessly without any interesting activity or just anything interesting.&amp;#x200B;I also have a question regarding enneagram.

404,1,"\- Always speaks her mind when she has a problem with something. For example, a girl in our table kept accidentally interrupting her. She sassily confronted her saying, ‚ÄúGirl are you gonna let me talk or nah? You keep interrupting me every few seconds.‚Äù The same girl was also eating a lot of the gummy bears my friend brought to class. My friend then said, ‚ÄúHide the gummy bears because if you don‚Äôt, she‚Äôll eat them all by the time we get back‚Äù in front of the girl‚Äôs face.\- Loves to brag about everything from her grades to her baking skills to how much she gyms. She tends to talk about how she‚Äôs a really nice, kind person. For example, she once took a survey for a stranger because she said she knows how it feels to not have people take a survey. \- She can be quite arrogant about her abilities, often bragging about how smart she is whenever she gets a good grade on an exam. Sometimes this arrogance leads to putting others down, like she once repeatedly told everyone around her, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do math‚Äù when she was solving math problems. However whenever she does poorly, she constantly talks about how she‚Äôs so stupid and how she‚Äôs sad. I assume it‚Äôs to get reassurance, but I‚Äôm not sure.\- Always thinks she‚Äôs right. We‚Äôve done group work problems together and I showed her an answer was wrong with evidence from online sources. However she refused to believe them and still stuck to her own answer, claiming that those online sources are incorrect.\- Aggressive personality and goes after what she wants. She typically doesn‚Äôt take my food when I offer her some. However I brought in expensive chocolate for our class table to share, and she ended up putting them under her desk then asked if she could have them all even though the others in our table only had one piece. After doing this, she justified herself saying her family never takes free things though.\- We had a class in the late afternoon and she left an hour early every class session to go to the gym since she refused to get home any later than her usual time. The professor passive-aggressively called her out on leaving class, but she disobeyed him and continued doing it, saying he can‚Äôt control her.\- She openly admitted to being rude, but says it‚Äôs a good thing because people of her culture are extremely blunt. \- Often struggles making up her mind about a decision because she keeps second guessing. Always asks detailed questions for a long time and says things like, ‚ÄúAre you gonna be able to help me out? I can‚Äôt fail.‚Äù\- Can get controlling in group work if no one‚Äôs doing anything, especially since she hates free riders. Once in a class, she yelled at a group member and demanded him to do work since he wasn‚Äôt doing anything. She said she can yell at them because she‚Äôs close to them (in her perspective).\- She‚Äôs extremely playful, enjoys teasing/roasting people at their expense, engages in a lot of banter, is always laughing. However she can take her jokes too far and is unaware when people get annoyed at her jokes. \- She‚Äôs pretty impatient and cares a lot about time. The first thing she prioritizes with choosing class schedules is the time. She also rushes to get home. However with classes, she also tries to avoid professors who are mean.\- Considers herself close to someone she meets only after a short period of time. She‚Äôll only have spoken to someone in class for a few weeks then say she‚Äôs close to them. \- She speaks to strangers as if she‚Äôs already friends with them. The first thing she ever said to me when we didn‚Äôt know each other yet was that she isn‚Äôt forgiving me for not choosing the college she wanted to go to, but couldn‚Äôt get into. She once also spoke to a stranger, asking them about her favorite boy band and fangirling about them.\- She does whatever she pleases to the point of even sneaking behind a professor‚Äôs desk to take pictures of his textbook without permission.\- Doesn‚Äôt like acting cheesy or expressing things like missing her friends when they leave. However she‚Äôs quite open with her emotions, often saying that she cried herself to sleep or how she‚Äôs so anxious or stressed over this or that. \- She boldly cheats on exams, taking out notes when the professor‚Äôs close in proximity. She has also gotten caught cheating before, but lied to the teacher and got away with it then proceeded to brag.\- Friendly, outgoing, very chatty, helpful, can be pretty loud, and can be generous at times. She has helped me out with homework assignments and given me free answers. She also sometimes brings food to share or gives me snacks for free (even though she gets them free).\- Has skipped classes to drive 8 hours to another city in order to go to her favorite group‚Äôs concert. \- Cheap unless it comes to her favorite boy band, which she‚Äôll spend hundreds for. She downloads free textbooks instead of purchasing them.\- She said many people find her intimidating when they meet her, probably because she has a strong personality and already acts like she‚Äôs close to whichever stranger she‚Äôs speaking to.\- Not sure if this is manipulation, but she wanted me to help her out with her internship and said she‚Äôs asking because she wants me to learn the useful information for my own good. She also kept trying to persuade me into doing the task, mentioning how all of her friends are doing it and listing reasons why it‚Äôs beneficial for me. Basically she reminded me of those marketing people who persuade sales.\- She was desperately looking for a job over the summer last year because she said she can‚Äôt stay home all day.\- Has given me unsolicited advice about paying my own bills to not leech off of my parents, etc.\- Her school note are really organized and color coordinated, but her clothes at home are in a huge pile.\- Enjoys keeping up with celebrities, running a celebrity fan page, baking and cooking, going to the gym, and watching anime.PS: I will admit my friend probably isn't healthy, but I still like her and don't

I eventually got the nerve to ask her to hang out and we have spent a lot of time together. She‚Äôs super fun to be around and her presence is really intriguing. It‚Äôs never a dull moment during our hang outs. We have had sex and we have been on dates, but she hates labels and does not want me to begin to classify us as anything other than friends, which I understand. She isn‚Äôt really ready for anything serious at the moment and I understand that too. My question though, is how do I approach her about becoming more serious when she is in a place more suitable for that? I feel like the thought of something more scares her and I don‚Äôt want to bring up something like that and tell her that I want to be with her just to have it result in me being pushed away or to have it ruin our friendship and how close we are. I like her a lot and I just worry that while I wait for her to be in a place for something serious, I‚Äôll become a back burner thought. Like one day I‚Äôll wake up and think she still isn‚Äôt ready for anything and then she‚Äôll end up with someone else. I know that I overthink things as an INFP and maybe some of this is illogical thinking, but this has just been weighing on me and I just wanted some insight from other ESFP‚Äôs.

449,1,"Hi guys, ENFP (F23) here who is trying to woo an ESFP (M24). We met at work and have always been good friends and physically affectionate, and then around a month ago we started sleeping together when I initiated sex with him. After than we were very wrapped up in each other, and the first time we slept together I heard him say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù under his breath. We would see each other almost every day and it was the happiest I‚Äôve been in a while. To put this into context, we‚Äôve met each other‚Äôs friends, we‚Äôve opened up emotionally to each other and clicked on many levels. Bearing in mind as well that we‚Äôve been good friends for a year up until now. However, I‚Äôm worried because that now we‚Äôre back at work he has been pulling away from me and not wanting to see me one-on-one. He doesn‚Äôt want to come over anymore, not even for sex, and when I asked he fobbed me off with the vague promise of a drink sometime. I believe he‚Äôs scared that I now want an exclusive relationship, which I would definitely like if he was up for it, but I‚Äôd also be happy just hanging out like we did before. Can anyone give me an insight into what he might be thinking, and how best to proceed? I don‚Äôt want to lose the potential of what we could have, but also I‚Äôm worried that I might be scaring him off completely and I wouldn‚Äôt have him in my life at all.

455,1,"So I (istp m) recently met this girl on a dating app, typically fun to be around, super social, aesthetically pleasing. I love her personality, she's funny and We had an instant connection. I'm an Istp but Also a charmer, if I like a girl, I know exactly what to say and how to say it, compliments and making her feel at ease, listen to her etc...So we hooked up on the second date but two weeks before we first met , a few days before she was hooking up with this other guy, she says she doesn't have feelings and that the sex had no emotions and she only recently found out he had a girlfriend etc but She kept going back.. And the thing is, she also told me she's not the type to have sex around with different dudes but still she admits she's been going on dates( let's say alot) just to get food, yes she did say that, just to get food, which makes me think she has a tendency of taking advantage of guys that like her. She's been partying and admit that she does have alot of guys hitting her up which isn't really a surprise to me, she's hooked up with with several guys the last few months but She also says she's never cheated before and the other day we went out and she posted me on her private snap, some guy she was talking to, texted her, cursing etc.. she told me she hooked up with him a year ago, once, then she turns around and says twice and a year ago she had a boyfriend so I was confused and pointed it out, she said she meant to say, last year, not year ago, that he was the first person she got with after her boyfriend but that it has been on and off. I let it slide but overall, I've had experiences with ESFPs in the past, it was great and I also know they don't have the best morals when it comes to dating and I know from experience, ESFPs tend to hide their different faces if they really like someone and don't want to be judged. I've been pretty non judgmental, we talk and I've been hooking up with different girls in the past and I'm also too non chalant to be judging others. I typically accept the good and bad side of people as long as the connection is genuine. There's also the fact that she needs her papers and her parents from abroad have been pressuring her and she has to get married in order to have them. We talked about it and I'd be willing to help her out in the future but she really wants to commit and  talks about marriage and having a husband which really isn't an ESFP trait as you guys mostly take relationships on a day to day basis, going with the flow. I just need an ESFP's intake on this situation. She seems like she genuinely likes me and we definitely have a connection, on the other hand I know she's looking for something. I'm just confused. Maybe she's hiding her true colors in fear of being judged or until she gets what she's looking for. Overral, I just texted her this:  And btw, I gotta tell you this. just be yourself. We talked about commitment and all of that other bullshit.. I'm really focused on myself and Yh I'm a free spirit too just like you are. Let's not rush commitment if it doesn't come naturally and is something you actually wanna do .. just don't limit yourself. You gotta want it bad enough to do so, or like us bad enough to stay with just me. So don't force yourself to commit to one person and let's build off what we have. I'm not gonna cheat, you're all I need . I'm gonna be chilling. Focused on growth while also having fun with only you. I'm definitely hooked , I have feelings for you but I'm not gonna expect much from you but honesty. Communicate and be your fun self. I'll be here for you. I'm yours if that's what you really want. Just go with the flow and if staying in one relationship is what you really want, it'll come naturally.So Fellow ESFPs, what do you think?

I also dislike laziness, pushovers, getting treated badly by people who I treated well, and people who aren‚Äôt independent.**What do you like/dislike most about yourself?**I like that I‚Äôm strong, independent, aggressive, good with money and investments, intelligent, outgoing, cheerful, funny, easygoing, and a good cook. I dislike that I was born with low energy  and bad health because it affects my ability to make more money. However, I wasn‚Äôt smart with money when I was younger (in my teen and young adult years) because I didn‚Äôt care about anything at all and I was extremely simple. I just lived day by day without caring about responsibilities even though I did still get all my work done and excelled in school.**Do you care about being fashionable? why/why not?**When I was young, I used to wear makeup and dress up in nice clothes because I liked impressing others. Now that I‚Äôm older and already a mom, I don‚Äôt care about looking good. I just want to be comfortable. When I shop, I look for comfort and cheap deals, often buying things that I don‚Äôt need just because the sale is good.**What makes you feel secure?**I feel secure when I have good investments, a lot of money, high savings, hardworking children who are married with kids, and when I‚Äôm careful about things. Because I‚Äôm paranoid of COVID, I get a sense of security from shopping for high quality masks, hand sanitizers, and staying at home. Also, when I shop for items, I have to triple check every detail to make sure it‚Äôs the right thing and that nothing is a scam.**What do you spend the most time thinking about?**I spend most of my time thinking about money and health. I really love reading health books and watching videos about health posted by doctors. I also always tune in weekly for this talk show that teaches people about investments, savings, and other tips when it comes to finances. I also spend a lot of time worrying about my children‚Äôs future. Aside from that, I like to find new recipes for different food I can try cooking, but I don‚Äôt listen to the directions at all. I will simply get a brief idea of how to cook it then do everything on my own without instructions. I find following recipes exactly how they should be annoying and tedious, so I usually just do taste tests.**How do you respond to clingy people?**My husband is pretty clingy and dependent on me, which can get annoying sometimes because I want everyone to be independent. I don‚Äôt have any strong opinion on clinginess, but I do value the freedom of doing things on my own at times and don‚Äôt like when people ask me things like where I‚Äôm going or when I‚Äôll be back home.**When you are romantically interested in an individual, how do you generally act (shy, outgoing, annoying, etc.)?**When I was young, I was shy and didn‚Äôt talk to my crushes. I just admired them from afar. I got married at age 18, so I can‚Äôt say how I‚Äôd act around a crush nowadays. However, all of my shyness was in the past and I‚Äôm extremely outgoing now.

490,1,"Some of my friends and I have trouble deciding if our friend is ESFJ or ESTJ, so I posted on those subreddits. However, someone suggested she may be an ESFP.\- People are often intimidated by her upon first meeting because she has a super strong personality. She likes to roast people and banter with them even if she's only known them for a day. She also appears extremely outgoing from the get-go, speaking to strangers as if she's already known them for a long time. I was intimidated by her because when we met from a group project, she was a bit rude, controlling, temperamental, and confrontational while leading us. However, I got to know her better after that and she redeemed herself because she has a very playful personality and doesn't have bad intentions when she acts mean. \- Her self-esteem fluctuates from very confident to sometimes being insecure, but she typically has high self-confidence. She likes bragging about her accomplishments, but when there are setbacks, she speaks about herself negatively (ex: calling herself dumb). She also speaks negatively as a way to get pity and possibly reassurance since she repeatedly insults herself.\- When it comes to school, she needs a lot of guidance. She always asks for my advice on which classes to register for and overthinks every choice. She fears taking classes alone because she thinks she might fail without friends. She takes super long to finalize a decision since she's always hesitating between choices and asking thousands of questions.\- She's good at understanding where others are coming from. One time, a stranger asked us to take a survery and I declined sicne I was lazy, but she helped and said it's because she knows how it feels from personal experience when people rejected her while she had a similar task.\- She can be pretty helpful and usually isn't the type of person to be greedy. I've offered her food and other things, but she typically doesn't take anything unless I insist. She gives me free food from her home sometimes and has let me copy her work. One of her biggest pet peeves is free-riders who take everything yet never give back. Although she's pretty nice, she can also exaggerate how good of a person she is. A lot of times she likes to tell stories about how kind-hearted she is.\- We've ditched class in the middle of a lab and our professor passive-aggressively called us out for it. She continued ditching and ignored what he said because she claimed he can't control us. \- Her hobbies include keeping up with male celebrities, running a fanpage of them, going to the gym, baking, and cooking. She skipped class to drive to a city 8 hours away for a concert.\- She's uncomfortable with cheesy things like giving goodbye speeches, but she's not really uncomfortable about speaking about her emotions. She's told me about crying herself to sleep, being stressed / anxious, and how she's emotional on her period.\- She has called herself a rude person but she doesn't see this as a bad thing since her family is like that. She's also somewhat aggressive with getting what she wants. One time I brought a variety of food for a few friends to share, but she snatched the whole thing asking if she could take it all even though the others barely had any.\- She exaggerates how hardworking she is, claiming that she doesn't know why she failed an exam when she studied nonstop for a week. At the same time, once she does well on an exam, she then claims she barely tried.\- She's quite concerned with saving time and is a fast-paced person. We both hate waiting for buses and often sprint to make the soonest one coming even if it'll be crowded. \- She feels close to people very quickly. As long as she speaks to someone a few times, she'll claim they're a friend and if she knows them on a level that's closer than a classmate, she'll say she's close to them.",Is my friend an ESFP,some of my friend and i have trouble deciding if our friend is esfj or estj so i posted on those subreddits however someone suggested she may be an people are often intimidated by her upon first meeting because she ha a super strong personality she like to roast people and banter with them even if she s only known them for a day she also appears extremely outgoing from the get go speaking to stranger a if she s already known them for a long time i wa intimidated by her because when we met from a group project she wa a bit rude controlling temperamental and confrontational while leading u however i got to know her better after that and she redeemed herself because she ha a very playful personality and doesn t have bad intention when she act mean her self esteem fluctuates from very confident to sometimes being insecure but she typically ha high self confidence she like bragging about her accomplishment but when there are setback she speaks about herself negatively ex calling herself dumb she also speaks negatively a a way to get pity and possibly reassurance since she repeatedly insult herself when it come to school she need a lot of guidance she always asks for my advice on which class to register for and overthinks every choice she fear taking class alone because she think she might fail without friend she take super long to finalize a decision since she s always hesitating between choice and asking thousand of question she s good at understanding where others are coming from one time a stranger asked u to take a survery and i declined sicne i wa lazy but she helped and said it s because she know how it feel from personal experience when people rejected her while she had a similar task she can be pretty helpful and usually isn t the type of person to be greedy i ve offered her food and other thing but she typically doesn t take anything unless i insist she give me free food from her home sometimes and ha let me copy her work one of her biggest pet peeve is free rider who take everything yet never give back although she s pretty nice she can also exaggerate how good of a person she is a lot of time she like to tell story about how kind hearted she is we ve ditched class in the middle of a lab and our professor passive aggressively called u out for it she continued ditching and ignored what he said because she claimed he can t control u her hobby include keeping up with male celebrity running a fanpage of them going to the gym baking and cooking she skipped class to drive to a city 8 hour away for a concert she s uncomfortable with cheesy thing like giving goodbye speech but she s not really uncomfortable about speaking about her emotion she s told me about cry herself to sleep being stressed anxious and how she s emotional on her period she ha called herself a rude person but she doesn t see this a a bad thing since her family is like that she s also somewhat aggressive with getting what she want one time i brought a variety of food for a few friend to share but she snatched the whole thing asking if she could take it all even though the others barely had any she exaggerates how hardworking she is claiming that she doesn t know why she failed an exam when she studied nonstop for a week at the same time once she doe well on an exam she then claim she barely tried she s quite concerned with saving time and is a fast paced person we both hate waiting for bus and often sprint to make the soonest one coming even if it ll be crowded she feel close to people very quickly a long a she speaks to someone a few time she ll claim they re a friend and if she know them on a level that s closer than a classmate she ll say she s close to them is my friend an,3710,711,0.111,0.146,0.743,0.9808

494,1,"Hey everyone.My name is Oliver Powell. I'm a psychologist and my personality type is is ESTP 8w7 sx/sp.I wanted to give all of you a warning, as I ran a check on the YouTuber CS Joseph and I found out that he's full of bullshits. He is a con artist and he is horrible at typology.1. MBTI is about cognitive preferences. It doesn't automatically equal skills. Chase doesn't keep that in mind, so he ends up using a lot of bullshit stereotypes. No wonder that he mistypes a lot of people.2. Any combo of enneagram and MBTI is possible. Enneagram covers basic motivations... But he disregards the enneagram, fusing automatically basic motivations within cognitive functions, ending up easily mistyping people. For instance he insists in claiming that Frank James is an INFP, when Frank James is an INFJ with enneagram 4w5.3. Some of the concepts that he talks about are in a nutshell a bastardized version of socionics model A, but repackaged with different terminology. For instance his ""four sides of the mind"" are called in socionics model A as ego block, id block (unconscious ego), super id block (subconscious ego) and superego block.4. He isn‚Äôt an ENTP as he claims. Chase is an unhealthy ESTJ (ego Te Si Ne Fi) 6w5 SO 613 often stuck in Te-Ne loops and on top of that he has most likely ASPD.First of all Chase is a Te Dom:4D valued Leading/Dominant Te: ""*Extroverted logic as base function is manifested as a need to accumulate factual information, also from external sources such as books, second-hand information, etc, on matters of personal interest or of professional activity. This also gives these types confidence on being well-informed on the same matters, which enables them to enter arguments related to them with confidence on their knowledge, which may come across as arrogance to others. Another manifestation is an evaluation of external reality - work activities, world events, finances, procedures, personal relationships, conversations - from the point of view of factual accuracy and ""making sense"" and efficiency. It leads to an inclination to be proactive in increasing the efficiency and reasonableness of the external world, as well as a sense of self-worth connected on being involved and productive in activities seen as useful, profitable, or that increase one's knowledge base. To give out information that the individual knows not to be factually accurate is disturbing and avoided as much as possible.""*His second slot Si is poorly developed and he often turns it off, enganging often in Te-Ne loops:*""ESTJs can also develop a warped or imbalanced use of their auxiliary function, Introverted Sensing (Si). When this happens,* ***they become obsessed with sticking to what they know, rapidly closing off alternate viewpoints and perspectives. They may become deeply upset by change¬† or they may become focused on seeing impracticalities in others. They may become so tied to their own personal, subjective experience that they discount other people‚Äôs experiences or are unwilling to see other perspectives.*** *Healthy Si is very aware of details, facts, sense-impressions, and important memories.

During these times, they become obsessed with possibilities, but often in a negative light. They may see a million ways things could go wrong and try to ‚Äújump in‚Äù and fix them as quickly as possible without looking at the facts or taking the time to carefully observe the situation internally. They may have a difficult time prioritizing or reaching their goals and they may take hasty action on strange, intuitive whims without really understanding where their premonitions are coming from. This can be a very stressful stage for them as they feel more and more frustrated by their inability to organize, plan, and decide as effectively as they usually do. It‚Äôs important for ESTJs who realize they‚Äôre in a Te-Ne loop to get healthy access to Si. Take some time to enjoy some peace and quiet and reflect on an experience you enjoy. Find a favorite activity that you‚Äôve always enjoyed, whether it‚Äôs a crossword puzzle or cooking a certain meal, and repeat that process.

And the default communication style of ISTP is the best way to communicate with ESTJs.**- Love/hate relationship with high Fi users, but in particular xNFP types.

They are extremely needy, and may abuse alcohol or drugs as a way of dealing with anxiety and paranoid delusions, as well as of bolstering their inferioirty feelings. The Five-wing adds elements of cynicism and nihilism to the fearful mentality of the unhealthy Six, resulting in growing isolation, desperation, and a capacity for sociopathic actions. Intense stress will likely lead to outbreaks of rage and extremely destructive behavior accompanied by breaks with reality. Self-sabotaging, self-destructive actions bring about humiliation and punishment to atone for guilt, although the extent and nature of their self-destructiveness will be hidden from others because of their reclusive nature.

496,1,"So I figured I'd talk about one of the most obvious ESFPs ever with Super Mario himself here from the Super Mario Bros game series. Mario is ESFP and is one of the best ones of all time as we all know and the biggest video game character in the world made by a ENFP video game creator being Shigeru Miyamoto himself, an Ne dom in Nintendo and core foundation on why Nintendo succeeded in the 90s with his Ne idea on making the Arcade game Donkey Kong way back then that blew up and changed the world as we know. Which all led to Mario Bros and the Super Mario Bros. series and games we know and love today. Miyamoto an ENFP made Mario an ESFP and Link an ISFP, so there you have it, some of the greatest video game characters of all time are SPs not NFs or intuitive, let's give it up for them here, Mario is the the best and greatest ESFP game character and best ESFP character possibly ever and here's why with my opinion down below.Super Mario Bros, can't wait to talk about this one and Mario here. Mario is energetic, fun, goofy, down to earth and practical. He's very hands on and is good with a hammer and a plumber at that which all works perfectly with his hands on Se and his Se reacting to details around him and using his hammer when necessary to smash things and enemies and his classic jumping ability as well. Mario uses his Se to jump very easily in the world around him and react and respond to details fully in the moment, he pays attention to all details around him with his Se and responds and reacts to details spontaneously and impulsively with his Se dom impulsiveness and spontaneity fully in the moment and is a excellent jumper because of it and his Se skills as an ESFP. He follows his inner values and heart inside which is all Fi, and doesn't care for what society says or thinks and goes on dangerous adventures and tries to save princess peach whenever he can and when necessary. He gets the job done with his Te ter and gets goals done with the things he cares about and is sometimes efficient when he can be and never fails to hop in and try to save Peach with a moments notice with his Te efficiency being third and Se jumping in on impulse in the moment and responding to details quickly when Peach gets kidnapped and jumping at the chance and moment to save her immediately without hesitation. He loves to entertain and perform in front of people with his jumped skills and Se and Fi as an ESFP performer, when he does his triple jump in some games he puts his hands up in the air like he just performed in front of people in a stage show or play he's in with the impression he's trying to show his jumping skills off to people and entertain them and perform in front of them and impress them with his great jumping skills and abilities he has with his Se. Any type can love physical activity and be good a doing physical things and like physical things too, including Ne users, but Mario clearly is a Se dom here with loving to pay attention to respond to all details around him with his Se and living fully in the moment with it too and just caring for reacting to details today only and not focusing on the past or future very much at all.Mario is also very adaptable with his Se being in the moment, he can adapt to any weather and new details he has to respond to in the sensory environment with his Se and he reacts to all details around them and pays attention to all details around him easily while respond to them quickly and spontaneously in the moment without fail with his Se dom behavior all the time no matter what terrain or situation he's in or presented with. He's a plumber again and uses a hammer, this is the perfect hands on image of Se and Mario's character. He's a very hands on Se dom and ESFP that follows his heart and jumps and performs and reacts and responds to details fully in the moment and doesn't really care about the future too much with his inferior Ni and just goes with the flow with his Se and focuses on what's going on fully in the moment and what's going on today as well and takes life day by day with his Se in general in each game he's always in. Some of the best games Mario has been in is Super Mario RPG, and Paper Mario series along with the great classic platformer Mario games we know and love today like the masterpiece game of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario Odyssey too along with many others like Galaxy and Mario 64.Mario is the classic ESFP and one of the greatest ESFP characters of all time. ESFP is the best personality type for a platformer game series and a jumpman plumber, which is what he was named and called initially as Jumpman first haha, who uses a hammer to hit things and fight with his hands on Se that responds to all details around him in the moment, Miyamoto hit the mark and made the best ESFP game character ever clearly here with Mario and we thank him so much for the genius idea and creation he made with this amazing character and game series he created and invented for us, thank you Shigeru Miyamoto for everything. Everyone knows Mario around the world so I don't need to explain this. Feel free to share your opinion on this down below on what you think, if your curious on the other major characters, I type Bowser ESTJ, Princess Peach ESFJ, Princess Daisy ENFP, Luigi ISFJ. I can do more later on like the Paper Mario series and Super Mario RPG posts in depth at a later date. In short I type Mallow INFP btw and Geno INTJ.Here's a great Mario ESFP post here by

But I score high on function tests for FE and often see myself as having FE but Im wondering if I'm not looking at it right and its harder to look at yourself sometimes I think.I am always atuned to how other people are feeling, I worry about how comfortable they feel and don't want to upset anyone. I'll be honest with others always but try and do it in a really fluffy tactful way as to not make them feel attacked. The whole morals/principles part of Fi isn't something I can pin down....what are your morals/principles...what does this mean for you?I DONT think everything is either good or bad and Ive often been accused of sitting on the fence, purely because I can sympathise with both sides a lot of the time and would rather respect each others differences.I guess the only time I really see Fi in myself is as a mother. I am so empathatic to the feelings of children and do not like harsh punishment, leaving to cry etc (not looking to debate this as its not the point). But yeah, when it comes to kids I can get very Fi, this is what i believe in and i feel strongly that x, y and z are wrong. I'll then try and evidence my feelings on these matters to try and put out a message to others. anyway if you got this far into my rambling let me know what you think...what is Fi for you? what are some good ways to differentiate between the two?

509,1,"(Sorry if this is long, being concise is not a strong suit) So I‚Äôve consistently never tested as anything other than ESFP-A over the last decade or so. I feel like I‚Äôm experiencing a sort of ‚Äúimposter syndrome‚Äù with being an ESFP though, mostly because of how practical and methodical I am. Does anyone else see their personality manifest in these ways?: Relationships: I get along with my INTJ boyfriend VERY well. I know practicality is a hallmark of ESFPs, but I feel like I plan plan plan like no other, which isn‚Äôt very typical of this type, but really helps in my relationship. We often face a disconnect on empathy (I‚Äôm a huge empath) but we mesh really well when it comes to being ‚Äúobsessive‚Äù about weird/nerdy things, and when getting things done together. I also tend to be very loyal in relationships, though I jump very quickly into a new one when they end (I ‚Äúbounce back quickly‚Äù).Events/life goals: I‚Äôm a chatterbox, willing to speak my mind on anything, and very comfortable improvising. However I often spend hours researching, preparing, and organizing for any event, trip, or life goal - is this typical of ESFPs?! Sometimes my planning is mobilized as socially-driven (I‚Äôll plan impeccable events, holidays, vacations for people) or experience-driven (I want to order the *best* thing from a new restaurant), but often I feel like I have a non-stop almost domineering desire to plan out my life and next steps. If I want something, (a relationship, a friendship, a job) I‚Äôm impatient, so I immediately jump into gear to get on a path for that ‚Äúthing‚Äù. Does anyone else relate to this? School/career: I was a precocious child and have always been exceptionally good at school and work. Despite a low-income background, I managed to get multiple degrees from prestigious schools, and I do analytical research for a living, where I leverage my charismatic energy to ‚Äúsell‚Äù my analyses and conclusions. Yet I never seem to see other ESFPs in these roles, and people are always surprised when I say I‚Äôm ESFP (I‚Äôve literally never met another ESFP in school or work).TLDR; I‚Äôm overly practical, forward-looking, booksmart, ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù, analytical, and constantly planning things. I ALWAYS test as an ESFP, and I feel like one socially, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm not ‚Äútypical‚Äù for this type.

Little kids really stress me out and I found it difficult to not feel a bit stifled by little kids. My sense of freedom was screaming but I am also a SAHM, so maybe if I had been working during this time or had a spouse that didn‚Äôt work long hours it wouldn‚Äôt have been so hard?  I now stress that I am too lenient with teens. I want to have fun with them, I don‚Äôt really like to force them to do many chores, I encourage them to go have fun with friends, and I just grant them maybe way too much freedom. I talk with them about everything and want them to trust me with their inner world and to know they could tell me anything and I wouldn‚Äôt freak out or judge them. I want them to fully experience life and choose their paths and happiness and I just want to be a cheerleader but sometimes I wonder if I need to be stricter?  I never have a clue.

521,1,"Gon FreecssGon MBTI - Gon Freecss is ENFPGon Freecss MBTI is ENFP - Hunter x Hunter MBTIThe thought the ESFP reddit would be interested and intrigued with my Gon Freecss ENFP argument here. I repost this old post I made to a few places and forums already and thought you guys would like this too. I‚Äôm very interested in your opinions and would like people to objectively  share their opinions down below without personal feelings coming into play with your liking of the character of other reasons that might cloud accurate judgement. Tell me what you think objectively and personally on the ENFP vs ESFP debate here, I would like to see if you guys agree with my ENFP points here for Gon and my arguement why I type him so since I think he gets confused a lot with you guys which is understandable.I posted this Gon Freecss ENFP post and argument I made a long time ago on the MBTI reddit and I'm really proud of it and love this post as a result through the years, I feel I fixed a lot of misconceptions people have with Gon's type and character with this and showed here how he uses Ne all the time, uses Si way more often than Se but still struggles with Si too to be an Si inferior user and acts very NF and is extremely idealistic as a character and NF as well in Hunter x Hunter. So I thought like I did a long time ago with my Goku ENFP repost from reddit that I did a long time ago, that I would post this one as well. Thanks for the support and feel free to share your opinions down below.Here's a Myers-Briggs post of why Gon is ENFP with just developed sensing, particularly developed Si and is actually an Ne user and uses Ne all the time and is a Ne dom for sure as an ENFP and Si user to over Se which Gon doesn't use much of at all in the series actually. Hope you enjoy this Hunter x Hunter MBTI - Myers-Briggs typing post, share your thoughts and opinions on my Gon Freecss MBTI analysis down below.So I decided I'm rewatching Hunter x Hunter again recently, and I haven't watched it in awhile but I know Gon's character and know he's ENFP and an Ne user with developed introverted sensing to help him survive in the Hunter world he's in. I'm going to write posts down below on why Gon Freecss is ENFP with just developed sensing but still Ne the whole series. I'm only on episode 2 on my rewatch right now, so I'm only gonna bring up a few points but even after 2 episodes I have perfect examples of his Ne and him being ENFP in the show, its already that obvious already so I'm gonna explain that down below. I'm going to update this post overtime as I watch the series so look forward to more content on why Gon is ENFP and uses Ne in the future, thanks.Gon starts off the series heading off to be a hunter after catching the lord of the sea and his stepmom Mito tries to convince him not to be a hunter because the world is dangerous and his father left him for the hunter life instead of raising him. Gon proceeds to tell Mito isn't that amazing for him to do that and leave his son to be a hunter, it must be that amazing. Gon displays here that he's the type to at times ignore realistic facts thrown at him and instead be idealistic and give people chances and the benefit of the doubt to consider the possibilities of why Ging left in the first place, he completely ignores Ging's hurtful actions and gives him a chance anyway, these are traits of ENFPs giving everyone a chance and Ne considering possibilities with people giving them the benefit of the doubt before judging them. Then he proceeds to say I don't know what the world is like and says he wants to know more about the world and why Ging left and where he is, he showcases Ne curiosity in this scene and wants to see the world and discover why Ging left and his location in the world, this is pure curiosity about the future and what's out there.Gon then uses Ne and Si on the ship to predict the storm. I'm going to be comparing this storm scene from the manga and anime and revising this part of my post since I did more research in the coming months up till now and have an even better understanding of the functions up to this point. So in the manga in chapter 2 Gon actually predicted the 2nd storm because there was two storms coming and that came in the manga where as the anime only showed one storm and had him predict that one. This obviously highlights his Ne because he's making a prediction and sees a possibility that will happen and believes in it, and further evidence of why he believes in his hunch of a big storm is coming in terms of the manga is he says the wind is tepid and salty and that the sea cranes are yelling out warnings, which showcases Gon's Si. Gon we can clearly interpret in this scene has been through this experience before with a big storm coming and these signs coming up, he remembers these conditions being met in his memory and their happening again which makes him able to make a confident prediction of a huge storm is coming and even predict the size of the storm and time frame it will hit when the captain asks him.This is all clearly signs of Si and Ne in Gon with remembering past experiences and seeing the conditions and circumstances of those past experiences arising again to be able to make a confident prediction that something will happen soon and is coming, Si and Ne coming out in Gon clearly in this scene. I'm glad I was able to fix this point in this post and understand it properly after more research on the functions because this scene always confused me I'll admit but I go it down now. And in terms of the anime, the scene in general plays out the same except without going into more detail about the salty wind and it being tepid and the part of predicting the time and size, and of course Gon only predicts the first and the only one storm that happened in the anime. But my points still stand in the anime version and manga version despite the differences in how they played out. This is one of many moments you see Gon's good introverted sensing skills that help him as a hunter but he does have Se moments as well that I'll mention if you read on even if not as much, and of course there is plenty of Ne moments in Gon that I'll mention if you keep reading forward.A perfect example of Gon using Si again that might go unnoticed for some people is also on the ship right after Kurapika and Leorio finish fighting. Gon stops the captain from yelling at them and telling them to comeback because Mito his aunt once told him, I'll again use the manga because the anime made some weird changes it worded it a little different, but the point still stands in the manga Gon tells us she said in the past to him: ""If you want to know a person, find out what makes him angry."" Gon states this is one of Aunt Mito's favorite sayings and then says they're both mad about something, we should leave them to work it out. This shows Gon is the kind of person more than most people to really treasure the past in terms of things that are meaningful and that he takes certain values and things he was taught in the past very seriously even now at his current age and time on the ship and that he doesn't forget these important values from the past. Gon showcasing he's the type of person to remember and treasure important values he was taught in the past further showcases his developed inferior Si as an ENFP, which is also similar to Luffy and Shanks with Luffy's actions in the bar scene in Jaya as an interesting parallel I noticed in Gon and Luffy here just to bring that up to compare. Luffy from One Piece is an obvious ENFP as well in my opinion and is very similar to Gon and has this similar parallel of treasuring values from the past and following till the end in current day in their lives. I could bring up more obvious parallels from other characters like Goku naming Gohan after Grandpa Gohan and putting the 4 star Dragon Ball on his hat, Luffy obsessing over no one ever damaging his Straw Hat and so on, but I think you get the point I'm getting at here by now reading this far so I'll move onto the next point. Again Gon's motivation to see Ging is Ne, he wants to find him to find more information about why he left him to be a hunter, the common desire in Ne users for exploration and information gathering based on curiosity caused by their Ne and what the function values. This curiosity for information from his Dad about his motivation drives Gon the entire series.But a perfect scene where you see how this is Gon's (Si) at work is when he's able to tell those giant rabbit guys apart by paying attention to their details and remembering how the other looked from memory and being able to compare them based on that memory and tell them apart (Si). Gon's developed Si is very interesting in this scene since Leorio couldn't tell them apart and he's an Si user as well which goes to show how experienced Gon is in the wilderness and shows his potential as a Hunter. Keep reading because the best part I have for Gon being ENFP and using Ne is written down below, it's literally the perfect scene.Another major Si moment in Gon is when he drank the poison drink made by Tonpa and given to him and his friends during the early exams. Gon starts drinking the juice and then stops immediately after tasting it and spits it out. He says I think this drink has gotten bad Tonpa, it tastes strange. He then tells Tonpa that he sampled and tasted plants and grasses back on his island and home in the past and because of that he knows and can tell when something tastes off and goes bad. This is perfect Si moment for Gon because he compared the taste of the drink to past experiences of tasting plants from his home town and island from him trying different plants back in the past when he was younger growing up on his island. He compared and contrasted those experiences and the tastes of those plants he once ate and consumed to the taste of the drink he drank right in that moment. And also he was aware of his body state at the touch of tasting the drink and his body told him this drink is bad and unsafe because of again the plants he tried and sampled on his island. So this whole poison drink scene was a major Si moment in Gon with him recognizing the poison based him tasting plants before on his island, so I just wanted to explain that here in depth since its such a major scene of Si for him.Now this next scene is shows major amount of proof Gon is ENFP and an Ne user, I'm surprised people missed this since this is such prime example of his Ne being used in the series, all the way back in episode two. If you haven't guessed its the two question quiz scene, now let me explain why Gon uses Ne here and this is the perfect scene for showing he's ENFP. Leorio proceeds to get mad because the right answer is subjective and that picking either choose is immoral because you should love each person the lady makes you have to choose from, this is a question you should struggle with if your a decent good person, which we see is the case with the three characters here. Kurapika explains to Leorio after they're done silence was the right answer, you weren't supposed to choose since it'd be immoral to quickly pick between the two and would be a struggle.Now after the quiz is over and everyone is ready to move forward, Gon is still thinking about the answer to the question and the possible scenarios! He takes a breath and sits there confused because he can't find the right answer, Leorio tells him they found the right answer and the quiz is over and you can stop now Gon, let's go now and move forward! Gon says I know the quiz is over but why should I stop thinking about the answer? He then proceeds to explain what if I run into that situation in the future and I can only save one person? He asks what should I do? It wouldn't right to pick only one of them but one day I might have to make that hard choice if the situation arises in the future suddenly one day. Extroverted intuition is about ""What If and What could be"" and all the possible scenarios in a situation, Extroverted Sensing is about ""What is and the here and now"" and how to handle a current situation presented to me completely now in the moment. An Se user in this scene would have struggled with the question like the rest did but once they heard the right answer would have been relieved and said good we found the right answer so now let's move forward. Gon literally continues to think about the possible scenarios and tries think of all the possibilities in this situation and find in an answer because he knows it's possible this scenario might possibly happen in the future and he should be prepared for it and think of all the possible options to handle it if it comes up. The old lady literally states that is the purpose of this test, you must be ready to face all the worst possible scenarios that may come your way in life because they may come out of nowhere without you expecting it in the future and that's literally what Gon does in this scene, considers all the possible options of the future in this scenario (Ne). This is a complete perfect example of Ne and extroverted Intuition in Gon and showcases why Gon is an ENFP. I rest my case, now on to the next part.I'll keep adding more examples as the show progress on my rewatch, but yeah I just wanted to clear up why Gon is not ESFP and why he is actually ENFP with just developed introverted sensing to help him survive in the crazy world he's been born into and to maintain his occupation and survive in the future as he grows Hunter, this is a series where you need sensing to survive, even for the most intuitive characters like Gon and Killua, an ENFP and INTP, and his Se is also strong as well but his Si is much stronger and shows up way more often in the story and series.___I have more to add now since I've gotten further on my rewatch. Episode 12 is a perfect example of Gon's Ne as well. When they got to the crossroads on picking the long and easy short path, they didn't have enough and were forced to fight to figure out who were gonna be the two people left behind and which three we're gonna move forward. Gon paid attention to the weapons and them hitting the walls and this sparked an idea to use them to help their situation. Gon's Ne saw the possibilities in the moment and gave him the idea to use the weapons to break down the wall in the long path to make a shortcut to the short, his Ne generated that possibility in his mind on the spot and gave them the answer to pass everyone and not leave anyone behind. That's literally what Ne is, thinking about all the possibilities in a situation and assessing all the options possible in the future, Gon does this perfectly in this scene and episode as well along with my other examples mentioned before. This a second prime example of Gon's Ne, further proving why he's ENFP and how he uses Ne in the series.Some more Ne moments of Gon is he comes up with Jajaken and he comes up with the idea to trick the Chimera Ant with the multiple arms by calling out a different Rock, Paper, Scissors attack than the one he actually used, just like kid Goku did to Jackie Chun back in Dragon Ball.I've gotten even further and have more to say and have evidence to oppose Gon's use of Se, and have proof that he doesn't use it in the series from a weakness I found, further showcasing how he uses Ne more.When Gon steals the badge from Hisoka, when he runs off he gets attacked by the black hunter guy with glasses. After he snipes him and knocks Gon over he proceeds to tell Gon he could have killed him thousands of times because he wasn't paying attention. He tells Gon he doesn't pay attention to his surroundings which is why he was able to snipe him and attack him like that and take his badge. This showcases Gon doesn't have Se dominant and his sensing isn't as strong as it seems even if in the series its decently developed, further showcasing Gon uses Ne much more instead and isn't very good at paying attention to his surroundings.Gon asks a lot of Ne curiosity questions all the time too since Ne users ask a lot of questions a lot in their life because of Ne curiosity seeing possibilities and wondering and imagining about everything they see in the world and with the people they meet. Killua even mentions this trait in Gon is useful when he says ""It's good to have some around who's not afraid of always questions."" Killua says this trait is good and useful in Gon when they try to runaway from Phinks and the Phantom Troupe guys right after the YorkNew City Arc ends and there at the auction and accidentally see them again right after being let go by them in the exchange for getting Chrollo back from them for Gon and Killua as a trade between two hostages during the arc.Gon used Ne and Si when he was training to predict where birds will be in the future with their movements to catch them. He focused and remembered their movement patterns with his Si and was trying to predict in the future of where they'll end up being based on remembering and memorizing their moving habits. This is the Ne and Si axis. Gon also sees a bird catching a fish and pays attention to it. He sees the bird catch the fish and remembers it and thinks about it and then when he sees another bird catch a fish he comes up with the idea on how to catch the bird, with it being going for the target the second if goes for its prey, another Ne Si moment in Gon once again. And the entire time he wasn't paying to attention to his surroundings that the black hunter comments about when he's shown hiding behind the bushes showing his low Se and rather Gon living in his own world with his Ne fully out of touch with reality while he focused on practicing to predict where the birds will be. Gon also came up with the idea with his Ne on to use the butterfly's to track Hisoka after remembering with his Si the detail of Hisoka being injured earlier in the past.Some more content as I continue to watch more of the series:Back in the cave with the snakes Gon believes in his hunch that the antidote is definitely there in the dead guy's clothes even if there is not much evidence it is there. He sees the possibility the antidote is there for sure even if there's a chance its not there at all.The appraiser guy assess Gon and his character, he says in his head Gon is a boy who approaches things with pure curiosity, he doesn't judge things or people too fast as good or bad he says. He highlights pure curiosity is Gon's unique attribute, that's a clear sign of Ne and Extroverted Intuition as well in Gon.Another Ne moment in Gon is when he says he had a hunch on how the selection for the players for Greed Island worked when they were waiting in the stands to start and get picked for the Greed Island game and participate. Killua was over analyzing the situation and the guy behind him told him how it worked and said how Gon predicted this ahead of time. Gon says yes to this and confirms he was trusting his hunch of how the selection for Greed Island was going and he trusted his hunch and focused on controlling his Nen to get ready for his turn the whole, this a major Ne moment in Gon and shows him relying on his hunches and intuition yet again for his decision making for a problem and situation that came up for them to handle and try to figure out so that they can keep moving forward with their goals as usual.So I have some examples now for inferior Si. The biggest example of this is like one of the examples I mentioned above of Gon noticing and telling the big rabbits guy's apart from observing them and remembering what one looked like and comparing one from memory to another, this is (Si) in a nutshell. Gon's Si is a strength and weakness since its very developed but still the last function he uses in the inferior function slot. Gon is not good with details and not good with remembering detailed information. I'm on the Greed Island arc and you see this trait of him when Gon gets confused with all the information of the dodgeball game coming at him, he gets confused and flustered easily with too many details and information. I remember this happening plenty of other times when Gon spaced out, was confused, and puzzled when heavy information was being throw at him throughout the series and his brain gets fried and smoke comes out of his ears. This happens also with the Knuckle explanation, along with the other moments in the series.The Genthru scene is also a huge Ne moment, since Gon mentions how he has to be selfish in this situation in his mind to Bisky and proceeds to go after a chance he sees to injure Genthru. Gon sees a possibility to attack Genthru and cause major damage to him but its a huge risk, Gon doesn't care and focuses on the idea because he sees the possibility to carry out this idea and he wants to do whatever he can to make this possibility come to fruition, even if there's a chance he'll lose both his arms and life in the process.My last points will be a few Ne moments that happened that I'll summarize from the Chimera Ant arc and idealism Gon showed in the arc as well. Gon shows Ne a few times this arc and I'll just mentioned two moments here. When the falling arrows come down onto the castle and then they charge in, they start running towards the stairs in that famous scene and Youpi sees them. They didn't expect the arrows to come down and just had to go with the flow and keep running and stick to the plan everyone thought in their mind but Gon has a Ne moment that nobody else sees here. He thought of the possibility ahead of time of what if Knuckle and the Chameleon guy got hit and we're dead on the ground still invisible? They didn't know the limit of his invisible powers so its was still possible, and if that possibility existed and happened then who was gonna fight Youpi if this series of possibilities happened? Gon realized all of this in an instant and instantly ran towards Youpi from the start assuming this happened and knew if these what if scenarios happened that he or someone had to deal with Youpi and he chose to go for it despite the risk and uncertainty, this a huge Ne moment in Gon and its scene that should be recognized and understood properly since its such a huge Ne moment so I hope I helped make it clear. Now the next one is Kite, Gon the entire arc sees the possibility to save Kite with his Ne, he blames himself and gets hung up on the past with his Si and he feels he's the reason Kite was captured and lost his arm. Despite all this and him regretting being there holding him back and causing that incident he hopelessly believes no matter what that Kite can be saved. No matter how unrealistic it seems or what facts get presented to him and hints that Kite can't make it, is dead, or can't be saved, he doesn't believe it until the very end when he brings Pitou with him to see and try to fix Kite anyway. Gon is idealistic about saving Kite this entire arc and doesn't listen to anyone or realism this entire time in the arc and even explodes at Killua for being level headed and telling Gon to stop at different times. He stays focused on the goal and his massive amounts of idealism for saving Kite no matter what and ignore any pratical or logical points that goes against his idealism and hope in the entire arc. It doesn't take until they finally get there to Kite and Pitou says Kite can't be saved that Gon finally breaks down and snaps and you already know the rest of what happens from there. So yeah, that's all my points for Gon being ENFP and my Ne and Si points for him so far for this post at least.Here's also a separate opinion and post that highlights the correlation of Nen types and categories and MBTI types as well and common personality MBTI characteristics that correlate with them and the different Nen types in Hunter x Hunter. It's a really great and awesome post and I highly recommend you check it out here down below. I think the poster did a really good job with this overall even I disagree with a few character typings here and there. The character MBTI types I do agree with that they typed here are Gon Freecss ENFP, Killua Zoldyk INTP, Kurapika INTJ, and I disagree but type Leorio ESFJ like most people do but we both at least agree Fe dom, and Hisoka is ENTP in my opinion and many others as well. Some others are also I personally type Chrollo INFJ list most and Franklin ISFJ but I'll stop there since this part will go on forever. Overall 3 of the main characters I agree with and Leorio and Hisoka are close to my opinion of them as well as Fe dom EXFJs and NTPs as well, that's similar enough to match with the Nen types and MBTI typings pairing anyway so its fine really. Anyways check out the post down below, its really great and well written and really well though out too:https://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/732ypx/nen_personalities_and_the_correlation_to_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",Sharing my Why Gon Freecss is (ENFP) and how he uses Ne and Si primarily more than Se post here - Hunter x Hunter MBTI,gon freecssgon gon freecss is enfpgon freecss is enfp hunter x hunter the thought the reddit would be interested and intrigued with my gon freecss enfp argument here i repost this old post i made to a few place and forum already and thought you guy would like this too i‚Äôm very interested in your opinion and would like people to objectively share their opinion down below without personal s coming into play with your liking of the character of other reason that might cloud accurate tell me what you think objectively and personally on the enfp v debate here i would like to see if you guy agree with my enfp point here for gon and my arguement why i type him so since i think he get confused a lot with you guy which is understandable i posted this gon freecss enfp post and argument i made a long time ago on the reddit and i m really proud of it and love this post a a result through the year i feel i fixed a lot of misconception people have with gon s type and character with this and showed here how he us ne all the time us si way more often than se but still struggle with si too to be an si inferior user and act very nf and is extremely idealistic a a character and nf a well in hunter x hunter so i thought like i did a long time ago with my goku enfp repost from reddit that i did a long time ago that i would post this one a well thanks for the support and feel free to share your opinion down below here s a myers briggs post of why gon is enfp with just developed particularly developed si and is actually an ne user and us ne all the time and is a ne dom for sure a an enfp and si user to over se which gon doesn t use much of at all in the series actually hope you enjoy this hunter x hunter myers briggs typing post share your thought and opinion on my gon freecss analysis down below so i decided i m rewatching hunter x hunter again recently and i haven t watched it in awhile but i know gon s character and know he s enfp and an ne user with developed to help him survive in the hunter world he s in i m going to write post down below on why gon freecss is enfp with just developed but still ne the whole series i m only on episode 2 on my rewatch right now so i m only gonna bring up a few point but even after 2 episode i have perfect example of his ne and him being enfp in the show it already that obvious already so i m gonna explain that down below i m going to update this post overtime a i watch the series so look forward to more content on why gon is enfp and us ne in the future thanks gon start off the series heading off to be a hunter after catching the lord of the sea and his stepmom mito try to convince him not to be a hunter because the world is dangerous and his father left him for the hunter life instead of raising him gon proceeds to tell mito isn t that amazing for him to do that and leave his son to be a hunter it must be that amazing gon display here that he s the type to at time ignore realistic fact thrown at him and instead be idealistic and give people chance and the benefit of the doubt to consider the possibility of why ging left in the first place he completely ignores ging s hurtful action and give him a chance anyway these are trait of enfps giving everyone a chance and ne considering possibility with people giving them the benefit of the doubt before judging them then he proceeds to say i don t know what the world is like and say he want to know more about the world and why ging left and where he is he showcase ne curiosity in this scene and want to see the world and discover why ging left and his location in the world this is pure curiosity about the future and what s out there gon then us ne and si on the ship to predict the storm i m going to be comparing this storm scene from the manga and anime and revising this part of my post since i did more research in the coming month up till now and have an even better understanding of the function up to this point so in the manga in chapter 2 gon actually predicted the 2nd storm because there wa two storm coming and that came in the manga where a the anime only showed one storm and had him predict that one this obviously highlight his ne because he s making a prediction and see a possibility that will happen and belief in it and further evidence of why he belief in his hunch of a big storm is coming in term of the manga is he say the wind is tepid and salty and that the sea crane are yelling out warning which showcase gon s si gon we can clearly interpret in this scene ha been through this experience before with a big storm coming and these sign coming up he remembers these condition being met in his memory and their happening again which make him able to make a confident prediction of a huge storm is coming and even predict the size of the storm and time frame it will hit when the captain asks him this is all clearly sign of si and ne in gon with remembering past experience and seeing the condition and circumstance of those past experience arising again to be able to make a confident prediction that something will happen soon and is coming si and ne coming out in gon clearly in this scene i m glad i wa able to fix this point in this post and understand it properly after more research on the function because this scene always confused me i ll admit but i go it down now and in term of the anime the scene in general play out the same except without going into more detail about the salty wind and it being tepid and the part of predicting the time and size and of course gon only predicts the first and the only one storm that happened in the anime but my point still stand in the anime version and manga version despite the difference in how they played out this is one of many moment you see gon s good skill that help him a a hunter but he doe have se moment a well that i ll mention if you read on even if not a much and of course there is plenty of ne moment in gon that i ll mention if you keep reading forward a perfect example of gon using si again that might go unnoticed for some people is also on the ship right after kurapika and leorio finish fighting gon stop the captain from yelling at them and telling them to comeback because mito his aunt once told him i ll again use the manga because the anime made some weird change it worded it a little different but the point still stand in the manga gon tell u she said in the past to him if you want to know a person find out what make him angry gon state this is one of aunt mito s favorite saying and then say they re both mad about something we should leave them to work it out this show gon is the kind of person more than most people to really treasure the past in term of thing that are meaningful and that he take certain value and thing he wa taught in the past very seriously even now at his current age and time on the ship and that he doesn t forget these important value from the past gon showcasing he s the type of person to remember and treasure important value he wa taught in the past further showcase his developed inferior si a an enfp which is also similar to luffy and shank with luffy s action in the bar scene in jaya a an interesting parallel i noticed in gon and luffy here just to bring that up to compare luffy from one piece is an obvious enfp a well in my opinion and is very similar to gon and ha this similar parallel of treasuring value from the past and following till the end in current day in their life i could bring up more obvious parallel from other character like goku naming gohan after grandpa gohan and putting the 4 star dragon ball on his hat luffy obsessing over no one ever damaging his straw hat and so on but i think you get the point i m getting at here by now reading this far so i ll move onto the next point again gon s motivation to see ging is ne he want to find him to find more information about why he left him to be a hunter the common desire in ne user for exploration and information gathering based on curiosity caused by their ne and what the function value this curiosity for information from his dad about his motivation drive gon the entire series but a perfect scene where you see how this is gon s si at work is when he s able to tell those giant rabbit guy apart by paying attention to their detail and remembering how the other looked from memory and being able to compare them based on that memory and tell them apart si gon s developed si is very interesting in this scene since leorio couldn t tell them apart and he s an si user a well which go to show how experienced gon is in the wilderness and show his potential a a hunter keep reading because the best part i have for gon being enfp and using ne is written down below it s literally the perfect scene another major si moment in gon is when he drank the poison drink made by tonpa and given to him and his friend during the early exam gon start drinking the juice and then stop immediately after tasting it and spit it out he say i think this drink ha gotten bad tonpa it taste strange he then tell tonpa that he sampled and tasted plant and grass back on his island and home in the past and because of that he know and can tell when something taste off and go bad this is perfect si moment for gon because he compared the taste of the drink to past experience of tasting plant from his home town and island from him trying different plant back in the past when he wa younger growing up on his island he compared and contrasted those experience and the taste of those plant he once ate and consumed to the taste of the drink he drank right in that moment and also he wa aware of his body state at the touch of tasting the drink and his body told him this drink is bad and unsafe because of again the plant he tried and sampled on his island so this whole poison drink scene wa a major si moment in gon with him recognizing the poison based him tasting plant before on his island so i just wanted to explain that here in depth since it such a major scene of si for him now this next scene is show major amount of proof gon is enfp and an ne user i m surprised people missed this since this is such prime example of his ne being used in the series all the way back in episode two if you haven t guessed it the two question quiz scene now let me explain why gon us ne here and this is the perfect scene for showing he s enfp leorio proceeds to get mad because the right answer is subjective and that picking either choose is immoral because you should love each person the lady make you have to choose from this is a question you should struggle with if your a decent good person which we see is the case with the three character here kurapika explains to leorio after they re done silence wa the right answer you weren t supposed to choose since it d be immoral to quickly pick between the two and would be a struggle now after the quiz is over and everyone is ready to move forward gon is still about the answer to the question and the possible scenario he take a breath and sits there confused because he can t find the right answer leorio tell him they found the right answer and the quiz is over and you can stop now gon let s go now and move forward gon say i know the quiz is over but why should i stop about the answer he then proceeds to explain what if i run into that situation in the future and i can only save one person he asks what should i do it wouldn t right to pick only one of them but one day i might have to make that hard choice if the situation arises in the future suddenly one day extroverted intuition is about what if and what could be and all the possible scenario in a situation extroverted is about what is and the here and now and how to handle a current situation presented to me completely now in the moment an se user in this scene would have struggled with the question like the rest did but once they heard the right answer would have been relieved and said good we found the right answer so now let s move forward gon literally continues to think about the possible scenario and try think of all the possibility in this situation and find in an answer because he know it s possible this scenario might possibly happen in the future and he should be prepared for it and think of all the possible option to handle it if it come up the old lady literally state that is the purpose of this test you must be ready to face all the worst possible scenario that may come your way in life because they may come out of nowhere without you expecting it in the future and that s literally what gon doe in this scene considers all the possible option of the future in this scenario ne this is a complete perfect example of ne and extroverted intuition in gon and showcase why gon is an enfp i rest my case now on to the next part i ll keep adding more example a the show progress on my rewatch but yeah i just wanted to clear up why gon is not and why he is actually enfp with just developed to help him survive in the crazy world he s been born into and to maintain his occupation and survive in the future a he grows hunter this is a series where you need to survive even for the most character like gon and killua an enfp and intp and his se is also strong a well but his si is much stronger and show up way more often in the story and series i have more to add now since i ve gotten further on my rewatch episode 12 is a perfect example of gon s ne a well when they got to the crossroad on picking the long and easy short path they didn t have enough and were forced to fight to figure out who were gonna be the two people left behind and which three we re gonna move forward gon paid attention to the weapon and them hitting the wall and this sparked an idea to use them to help their situation gon s ne saw the possibility in the moment and gave him the idea to use the weapon to break down the wall in the long path to make a shortcut to the short his ne generated that possibility in his mind on the spot and gave them the answer to pas everyone and not leave anyone behind that s literally what ne is about all the possibility in a situation and assessing all the option possible in the future gon doe this perfectly in this scene and episode a well along with my other example mentioned before this a second prime example of gon s ne further proving why he s enfp and how he us ne in the series some more ne moment of gon is he come up with jajaken and he come up with the idea to trick the chimera ant with the multiple arm by calling out a different rock paper scissors attack than the one he actually used just like kid goku did to jackie chun back in dragon ball i ve gotten even further and have more to say and have evidence to oppose gon s use of se and have proof that he doesn t use it in the series from a weakness i found further showcasing how he us ne more when gon steal the badge from hisoka when he run off he get attacked by the black hunter guy with glass after he snipe him and knock gon over he proceeds to tell gon he could have killed him thousand of time because he wasn t paying attention he tell gon he doesn t pay attention to his surroundings which is why he wa able to snipe him and attack him like that and take his badge this showcase gon doesn t have se dominant and his isn t a strong a it seems even if in the series it decently developed further showcasing gon us ne much more instead and isn t very good at paying attention to his surroundings gon asks a lot of ne curiosity question all the time too since ne user ask a lot of question a lot in their life because of ne curiosity seeing possibility and wondering and imagining about everything they see in the world and with the people they meet killua even mention this trait in gon is useful when he say it s good to have some around who s not afraid of always question killua say this trait is good and useful in gon when they try to runaway from phinks and the phantom troupe guy right after the yorknew city arc end and there at the auction and accidentally see them again right after being let go by them in the exchange for getting chrollo back from them for gon and killua a a trade between two hostage during the arc gon used ne and si when he wa training to predict where bird will be in the future with their movement to catch them he focused and remembered their movement pattern with his si and wa trying to predict in the future of where they ll end up being based on remembering and memorizing their moving habit this is the ne and si axis gon also see a bird catching a fish and pay attention to it he see the bird catch the fish and remembers it and think about it and then when he see another bird catch a fish he come up with the idea on how to catch the bird with it being going for the target the second if go for it prey another ne si moment in gon once again and the entire time he wasn t paying to attention to his surroundings that the black hunter comment about when he s shown hiding behind the bush showing his low se and rather gon living in his own world with his ne fully out of touch with reality while he focused on practicing to predict where the bird will be gon also came up with the idea with his ne on to use the butterfly s to track hisoka after remembering with his si the detail of hisoka being injured earlier in the past some more content a i continue to watch more of the series back in the cave with the snake gon belief in his hunch that the antidote is definitely there in the dead guy s clothes even if there is not much evidence it is there he see the possibility the antidote is there for sure even if there s a chance it not there at all the appraiser guy ass gon and his character he say in his head gon is a boy who approach thing with pure curiosity he doesn t judge thing or people too fast a good or bad he say he highlight pure curiosity is gon s unique attribute that s a clear sign of ne and extroverted intuition a well in gon another ne moment in gon is when he say he had a hunch on how the selection for the player for greed island worked when they were waiting in the stand to start and get picked for the greed island game and participate killua wa over analyzing the situation and the guy behind him told him how it worked and said how gon predicted this ahead of time gon say yes to this and confirms he wa trusting his hunch of how the selection for greed island wa going and he trusted his hunch and focused on controlling his nen to get ready for his turn the whole this a major ne moment in gon and show him relying on his hunch and intuition yet again for his decision making for a problem and situation that came up for them to handle and try to figure out so that they can keep moving forward with their goal a usual so i have some example now for inferior si the biggest example of this is like one of the example i mentioned above of gon noticing and telling the big rabbit guy s apart from observing them and remembering what one looked like and comparing one from memory to another this is si in a nutshell gon s si is a strength and weakness since it very developed but still the last function he us in the inferior function slot gon is not good with detail and not good with remembering detailed information i m on the greed island arc and you see this trait of him when gon get confused with all the information of the dodgeball game coming at him he get confused and flustered easily with too many detail and information i remember this happening plenty of other time when gon spaced out wa confused and puzzled when heavy information wa being throw at him throughout the series and his brain get fried and smoke come out of his ear this happens also with the knuckle explanation along with the other moment in the series the genthru scene is also a huge ne moment since gon mention how he ha to be selfish in this situation in his mind to bisky and proceeds to go after a chance he see to injure genthru gon see a possibility to attack genthru and cause major damage to him but it a huge risk gon doesn t care and focus on the idea because he see the possibility to carry out this idea and he want to do whatever he can to make this possibility come to fruition even if there s a chance he ll lose both his arm and life in the process my last point will be a few ne moment that happened that i ll summarize from the chimera ant arc and idealism gon showed in the arc a well gon show ne a few time this arc and i ll just mentioned two moment here when the falling arrow come down onto the castle and then they charge in they start running towards the stair in that famous scene and youpi see them they didn t expect the arrow to come down and just had to go with the flow and keep running and stick to the plan everyone thought in their mind but gon ha a ne moment that nobody else see here he thought of the possibility ahead of time of what if knuckle and the chameleon guy got hit and we re dead on the ground still invisible they didn t know the limit of his invisible power so it wa still possible and if that possibility existed and happened then who wa gonna fight youpi if this series of possibility happened gon realized all of this in an instant and instantly ran towards youpi from the start assuming this happened and knew if these what if scenario happened that he or someone had to deal with youpi and he chose to go for it despite the risk and uncertainty this a huge ne moment in gon and it scene that should be recognized and understood properly since it such a huge ne moment so i hope i helped make it clear now the next one is kite gon the entire arc see the possibility to save kite with his ne he blame himself and get hung up on the past with his si and he feel he s the reason kite wa captured and lost his arm despite all this and him regretting being there holding him back and causing that incident he hopelessly belief no matter what that kite can be saved no matter how unrealistic it seems or what fact get presented to him and hint that kite can t make it is dead or can t be saved he doesn t believe it until the very end when he brings pitou with him to see and try to fix kite anyway gon is idealistic about saving kite this entire arc and doesn t listen to anyone or realism this entire time in the arc and even explodes at killua for being level headed and telling gon to stop at different time he stay focused on the goal and his massive amount of idealism for saving kite no matter what and ignore any pratical or logical point that go against his idealism and hope in the entire arc it doesn t take until they finally get there to kite and pitou say kite can t be saved that gon finally break down and snap and you already know the rest of what happens from there so yeah that s all my point for gon being enfp and my ne and si point for him so far for this post at least here s also a separate opinion and post that highlight the correlation of nen type and category and type a well and common personality characteristic that correlate with them and the different nen type in hunter x hunter it s a really great and awesome post and i highly recommend you check it out here down below i think the poster did a really good job with this overall even i disagree with a few character typing here and there the character type i do agree with that they typed here are gon freecss enfp killua zoldyk intp kurapika and i disagree but type leorio esfj like most people do but we both at least agree fe dom and hisoka is entp in my opinion and many others a well some others are also i personally type chrollo infj list most and franklin isfj but i ll stop there since this part will go on forever overall 3 of the main character i agree with and leorio and hisoka are close to my opinion of them a well a fe dom exfjs and ntps a well that s similar enough to match with the nen type and typing pairing anyway so it fine really anyways check out

Like I'm working on something and she'll knock on my door and be like ""OH MY GAAAAD MY LATTE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH LACTOSE-FREE MALLKKK, CAN YOU FILL IT WITH 1/4 SUGAR AND THE 20% 1/5 CUP OF MILK AND LACTOSE FREE-MALKKK"" and then I'm talking to someone and she'll interrupt and start making very minute demands with a super rude tone of voice like people are her slaves. I don't know if this is because she lives in the moment, or she's just an asshole, but it's annoying af. I try to put myself in her shoes but I NEVER act like that when I'm sick or need help. I'm always the MOST considerate when it comes to minimizing time waste when it comes to people helping me and not being a burden on them.We literally just had an argument and ngl I feel fucking great because now she can go be salty and not annoy me. For me to give my time to someone is a HUGE thing and when it's not valued or disrespected, that's literally a nono for me. Any tips for this situation?","Any tips? I (INTP) have a sick ESFP sister who constantly makes demands for help (which is totally fine since she's sick), but she asks to the point of it being inconsiderate because she's overly needy for assistance and she doesn't try to make it easier and she also speaks in a ""DO THIS NOW"" tone.",it honestly gross me out because it s like i m going out of my way to give you my time and be a helpful sibling and then it s like that kindness is then shit on and viewed a a given when i told her to be a bit more chill or considerate with the demand in a very respectful way she literally take it a an affront to her character and snap and block my door and just go on and on and go like you re making me feel like burden i m not responsible for managing people s like literally you are a burden that s why you feel that way the worst part is she asks for help for the dumbest shit like i m working on something and she ll knock on my door and be like oh my gaaaad my latte doesn t have enough lactose free mallkkk can you fill it with 1 4 sugar and the 20 1 5 cup of milk and lactose free malkkk and then i m talking to someone and she ll interrupt and start making very minute demand with a super rude tone of voice like people are her slave i don t know if this is because she life in the moment or she s just an asshole but it s annoying af i try to put myself in her shoe but i never act like that when i m sick or need help i m always the most considerate when it come to minimizing time waste when it come to people helping me and not being a burden on them we literally just had an argument and ngl i feel fucking great because now she can go be salty and not annoy me for me to give my time to someone is a huge thing and when it s not valued or disrespected that s literally a nono for me any tip for this situation any tip i intp have a sick sister who constantly make demand for help which is totally fine since she s sick but she asks to the point of it being inconsiderate because she s overly needy for assistance and she doesn t try to make it easier and she also speaks in a do this now tone,1810,389,0.134,0.152,0.714,0.7499

548,1,"I‚Äôve had a hard time learning new things. Concepts often seem to go over my head and I rarely ever recall what I thought I learnt. Over time, I realized that it was because I never truly understood what I was learning.The Feynman technique is particularly effective at helping you master difficult concepts. Named after the Nobel Prize winning Richard Feynman, the concept focuses on explaining a difficult concept in easy to understand language as if you were explaining it to someone else (or a child). By following the Feynman technique, you might just end up learning difficult concepts quickly, spend less time studying, and remember concepts longer.The four steps are as follows:1. Write the concept down2. Explain it using simple language3. Address (look up) problematic areas or questions that remain4. Challenge yourself to simplify it furtherI have found this to be a powerful concept that helps you cut study time shortly. The push to understand and explain a concept forces you to identify areas where you have a gap in your understanding.

Something as simple as stargazing or going out skateboarding in a new area in town is the simple pleasure that I really live for.* I like to be a comedian for others. Whether that‚Äôs starting to dance when a catchy song plays and making everyone laugh, or simply getting a smile out of people, I tend to be funny but not necessarily in the Ne random way but more-so accommodating others and being goofy at certain moments that allow me to.* I‚Äôm very creative but I prefer my creativity to be tangible. I actually enjoy writing but I hate writing or reading things that consist of strange universes or alien planets, I love things that have a realistic implication, a story about a real life situation or The Hunger Games which is a realistic dystopia instead of a random planet. A lot of my creativity involves the 5 senses. I love to paint for the sight, dance to feel one and immersed with my body and music, sing to make sounds, and I‚Äôm a pretty good cook even if I don‚Äôt enjoy the tediousness of it at times.* Without sensory experiences I tend to feel very empty. Whenever traveling I look for places to waterski or surf, or anything like a place that has karaoke night. I believe that doing fun things like this with my friends makes life so much more enjoyable than boring museums or just looking at places and not doing anything.* I have very strong morals and I tend to shut down when I see people imposing them. I tend to treat everyone as an individual deserving of the same respect. I am very observant to people‚Äôs emotional states and make an effort to make everyone feel included.* I‚Äôm very good at knowing how I feel and I might sometimes be very aware and sensitive if I‚Äôm being left out. I tend to use these emotions as self expressions and an outlet for creativity. My inner world is the source for my outer expression.* I am described as affable and childlike. I tend to wave my hand frantically with eagerness at someone I know across the street, and enjoy random small talk and conversation with anyone I know whenever I can get it.* I can be very goal oriented and look to the outer world as a guide to becoming better. I tend to measure myself based on external standards such as goals or discipline when it comes to the things I‚Äôm passionate about. I tend to have a desire to be the best I can be at my passions and work to get there. But I‚Äôm pretty lazy most of the time, haha.* I suck at math and I absolutely can‚Äôt stand lectures. When teachers allow us for us to do group work, to be creative with our work and to apply the learning to something I can actually use in my life, I feel really happy and immersed into the subject.* Is this inferior Ni? I hate when people ask me where I see myself in ten years. What I‚Äôm preoccupied with is the experiences I can have now or in the short term future. I don‚Äôt know what I want to do or where I want to be, and it stresses me out. I notice I tend to think of the future in terms of relationships. For example: I want you as my friend in the future, I want this relationship to be our future. But I tend to stop there and when I do think of the future it‚Äôs when I‚Äôm unhealthy and thinking: The future is doomed, the worst outcome is going to happen, the future is going to screw me over.

I really don‚Äôt like to have shallow relationships and I search for meaningful connections with friends and others around me. I don‚Äôt have the obliviousness to connections and meaningful things the way the descriptions say so.* I definitely can see the abstract meaning behind things and for example can see a relationship being like a flower starting from the dirt and growing out. But I don‚Äôt enjoy having abstract concepts all the time, I need a balance for the simple pleasures of life and analyzing the deep stuff.* I tend to sometimes be aloof and guarded if I don‚Äôt fit in. Sometimes if I feel the people around me are immoral I tend to shut down and act as more of a quiet loner. I‚Äôm not an extrovert hundred percent the time but I‚Äôm very loud and outgoing when I feel comfortable.* I've gotten pretty into MBTI which means I feel maybe my Ni is higher.  I've had a hard time typing myself and for some reason seem to lean between a mix of ENFJ and ESFP during tests with Ne being nonexistent. I feel that me wanting to know who I really am might make me an intuitive, but I personally feel being a sensor is way cooler.* I can be unobservant and spacey.  I notice when I'm bored I tend to have mind fogs where I don't really notice anything around me. I tend to not notice the porch got swept and things being misplaced but I'm also engaged and in touch with fun activities like dancing. I don't really daydream but it's more of a mind fog that I find myself in when I'm bored or not fully engaged in something. It makes me feel like an Ne user especially since I can at times be told to pay attention and that I'm not really 'there', but then when I'm really enjoying something I feel really in tune and attentive to the world.

562,1,"This is version one. Give some feedback plz. I couldn‚Äôt find something like this online so here we go.   * **Bacchus/Dionysians:**Examples: various pop icons, Kardashians, actors, comedians, fighters, local drug dealers. This is where the party animal stereotype comes from. Fi-&gt;Te in the middle. They're animalistic and often draw a varied party regardless of if they want to. They know what they enjoy and they go after it. That's all. In their mind, they're just tryna make themselves happy and provide a service for people at the time. A great formula for life right? An issue may arise when their happiness takes precedence and they sour on the service part. They may ghost on a moments notice, try self-sabotage, find an easy route, or stabilize their service to provide a steady income if they're more mature. Fifty years ago they'd see all the shows at the theatre, drink the finest wine, and play a relaxing sport. Now... they just go on their phones all day... Though to be fair, who doesn't? Sometimes what they enjoy is not enjoying the stuff other people like. Dislikes are just as strong as likes. You'll see ESFPs who are punk rockers, who don't use social media, who are straight edge, never watched porn in their lives or who claim they don't like people. They almost live for infamy. This should be a whole section on its own...Sometimes what they like is being a Paris Hilton, as we're all aware of. More mature Dionysians can visualize simulations of the near future and plan for it. They usually anchor their Fi to it. It's like this: If I can do a touch of Ni and not fuck myself over, then I can do all the Fi I want. Win-win. The same with all ExxPs, they'll burn everything down if you try to control them. Some can be seen as sellouts, as they want their cake, and to eat it too. Most of the time it's just good business. Some value entertaining overall: Justin Gaethje said he'd rather lose than have a boring fight. This encapsulates the Bacchus spirit in ESFPs. They'd rather win, but the idea of going the boring route for that... just no. Often mistaken for: ESTPs who have an inside joke that they don't care who gets. ENFPs who are less abstract or hippy-ish. ESFJs who aren't obsessed with people.  * **Titan:**Examples: popular ex-military dudes, actors, fitness dudes, firefighters, politicians. Fi is one of the most animalistic functions. One doesn't even need a reason to go after what they want. If they can tap into that single-minded Ni at the bottom and lock onto a goal they're unstoppable. Beings that keep going forward and never stop.Known for those motivational videos on youtube where the guys shouting at you to get out of bed at three fifty-eight in the morning and tie your shoelaces. Your legs are broken? Good. Now get back on that elliptical. They'll go through hell and high water to achieve what they want. The issue being, if they're on the wrong path, they'll go through hell and high water to fall off a cliff. You're one on one against life playing Russian roulette for the holy grail. Think of it like the titans in ‚Äòattack on titan‚Äô, even the titan shifters. They see a goal, they go for it, that's it. They only vary on maturely that attack their targets. They're often less fearful of control as they know it's a necessary part to achieve your goals. More mature titans fear no man, as they're conscious that man is just a bag of flesh and blood. Therefore they can't fear man‚Äôs control and can bust out of it at a moments notice. Often mistaken for: Little more personable and little less tactical ENTJs \[easy to see how they dominate politics\].

570,1,"Here's for a new audience for this post. Wanted to post some really great anime ESFPs that I think truly are ESFP in my opinion. You probably already guessed and noticing some ESFP and ENFP confusion online since you guys look so alike from each other and everyone has their own opinions which is fine. But I wanted to do this today and share my personal opinion on anime characters that I see that are definitely ESFPs in my opinion and are great and amazing characters as well and very well written too. You guys complain for good reason that the MBTI community doesn't do you justice and stereotypes you guys too often and get prejudged a lot by stereotypes you guys are known for and I feel you.Here are the other MBTI anime characters I made in the past, the INTJ one is my most recent one as of now: [https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/hctvvy/entj\_anime\_characters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/hctvvy/entj_anime_characters/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/hdakhy/enfp\_anime\_characters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/hdakhy/enfp_anime_characters/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/hi9anf/intj\_anime\_characters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/hi9anf/intj_anime_characters/) So I wanted to do this post as a thanks for being awesome and discussion of what anime characters I think are ESFPs for sure and are great characters as well in the anime community. Now I'm gonna get this out of the way, I'll share my opinion on the big ones that people debate often for anime main characters that get debated ENFP vs ESFP in the community. In my opinion I type Goku, Gon Freecss, Luffy, and Naruto ENFPs, I feel they've shown Ne and Si each plenty of times to argue the case for each one and make the case for why their each individually ENFPs. That's my opinion though, if you agree or disagree feel free to share your opinions down below. I'll posts links to posts I've made on them or other people's post on them that I agree with if you want to see evidence for why I think so for each character. I personally see Ash Ketchum ENFP too but that's my opinion as well. Share your opinions down below again if you feel you want to or feel differently about something, I'll post the links down below. But this post isn't about them, it's about other characters that I see in my opinion as awesome ESFPs and great characters that people already know and love or need to talk about more and give more love and attention to and should recognize as awesome ESFP characters, alright enough with the essay I'll post my opinions down below now:&amp;#x200B;Great post on Mario too by the way:[https://www.google.com/amp/s/funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/158027721211/super-mario-brothers-mario-esfp/amp](https://www.google.com/amp/s/funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/158027721211/super-mario-brothers-mario-esfp/amp)&amp;#x200B;My Goku ENFP opinion and analysis:\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku\\\_is\\\_an\\\_enfp\\\_and\\\_heres\\\_why\\\_dragon\\\_ball\\\_z\\\_mbti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku\_is\_an\_enfp\_and\_heres\_why\_dragon\_ball\_z\_mbti/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku\_is\_an\_enfp\_and\_heres\_why\_dragon\_ball\_z\_mbti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku_is_an_enfp_and_heres_why_dragon_ball_z_mbti/))My Gon Freecss ENFP post:\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/d7pprz/why\\\_gon\\\_freecs\\\_is\\\_enfp\\\_and\\\_uses\\\_ne\\\_primarily\\\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/d7pprz/why\_gon\_freecs\_is\_enfp\_and\_uses\_ne\_primarily\_over/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/d7pprz/why\_gon\_freecs\_is\_enfp\_and\_uses\_ne\_primarily\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/d7pprz/why_gon_freecs_is_enfp_and_uses_ne_primarily_over/))A Luffy post I agree with, Me and my ISFJ friend are working on a Luffy ENFP post now together for Reddit, it should be out soon but here's this for now:\[[https://practicaltyping.com/2018/08/31/monkey-d-luffy-enfp/](https://practicaltyping.com/2018/08/31/monkey-d-luffy-enfp/)\]([https://practicaltyping.com/2018/08/31/monkey-d-luffy-enfp/](https://practicaltyping.com/2018/08/31/monkey-d-luffy-enfp/))Naruto, surprisingly I haven't done a Naruto post yet but I know he's ENFP in my opinion and I've been watching the anime again and I see his Ne and Si in the first 7 episodes, I'm gonna make a Naruto post in time once I finish my rewatch and reread so until then I'll just link this post I agree with, tell me what you think on it if you want:\[[https://fictionalcharactermbti.tumblr.com/post/160992147849/hello-i-always-agreed-with-your-typing-of-naruto](https://fictionalcharactermbti.tumblr.com/post/160992147849/hello-i-always-agreed-with-your-typing-of-naruto)\]([https://fictionalcharactermbti.tumblr.com/post/160992147849/hello-i-always-agreed-with-your-typing-of-naruto](https://fictionalcharactermbti.tumblr.com/post/160992147849/hello-i-always-agreed-with-your-typing-of-naruto))Now for the awesome characters I see as clear ESFPs in my opinion, here's my list of all them written out for you guys:Awesome ESFP anime characters:Kuwabara - This man is amazing and one of my favorite anime characters of all time. He's fantastic and relatable and very funny and down to Earth. He has a heart of gold and great morality and has a awesome dynamic between him and Yusuke who's ESTP. Kuwabara is sometimes mistyped ESFJ but no this man is ESFP for sure, he uses Se and Fi all the thime and he's an awesome ESFP anime character at that. Overall great character, gonna make a character analysis on him when the time comes when I get to rewatching Yu Yu Hakusho again.Knuckle - Another great Kuwabara like character, made by Togashi again. Very manly and tough but has a soft side that the show often gets on him for and its very funny side to his character. Again heart of gold and great morality, he loves animals, he helps Gon out even though Gon got mad at him for it, haha. Knuckle is great what more do I need to say, he's an amazing character and one of Togashi's best.Brook - One of the best straw hats from One Piece. One of the best characters in One Piece as well. Most people agree on this, he's amazing and extremely creative idea on Oda's part. He's a talking skeleton with an Afro with a extremely sad backstory but still keeps his sense of humor and is very down to earth as well. He loves to perform and make music and make people laugh and make jokes. He's more practical than Luffy which is a nice touch and is realistic and loyal to Luffy and Laboon. He make his own band and music artist career of sorts which is amazing and hilarious at the same time. He was incredible in the New World especially in the Big Mom arc, anyone that seen the arc knows what I'm talking about. It's Brook what more do I need to say, Soul King will live on forever.Mina Ashido - One of the more newer ones, she's spontaneous and in the moment and loves to dance and party. She likes to break dance and get involved in class activities and likes to get everyone else involved as well in the fun. She's bright and energetic and full of life and has a interesting and unique design to her. Love Mina she's a great character and one of the best characters in class 1-A.Joey Wheeler - Now where do I begin. This guy is a fantastic character and probably started the heart of gold ESFP stereotype first before among all of them. Joey is an awesome character with great morality and tons of funny humor to him as a character as well, its true he started off a bully to Yugi but once they changed and Yugi helped him he never left his side and stayed loyal to him till the end. Joey is great an amazing character and I always loved when he was on screen and the duels he was apart of in the series.Ty Lee - from Avatar she's a rather interesting one. She seems one note at first and just attractive and all that initially. But as the series progressed we learn more about her and her backstory and learn to empathize with her more rather than our first initial impression of her in the beginning when they were around the campfire. She might not seem to important of a character among the cast to some people out of all the Avatar cast but I felt her character was done well enough to mention her here so here you go, Ty Lee is among the greats.Asta - Another newer one from Black Clover. I think Asta is an interesting case for a character so far. I haven't gotten too far in Black Clover so I don't have too much to say about him but from what I've seen I'm starting to like his character more and can see his determination and drive to reach his goals and do whatever it takes to get to where he wants to be to be Wizard King. He's shaping up to be great and more interesting so I wanted to mention him here since I feel he deserved it and it was necessary.Kirishima - One of the best characters in My Hero Academia. He's great and reacts to details around him very quickly and very well. Any type can fight in a physical way but in his case he does have a very physical fighting style is all about offense and defense with his hardness powers. He lives fully in the moment, reacts to details quickly and pays attention to his surroundings and details around him very well, he has strong inner values and is very emotional and has great morality and a heart of gold with his Fi and with his belief in manliness especially when someone does a good deed that he sees as moral and right. Despite his toughness he shows us his vulnerable side and emotions especially in his backstory, he looks up to his favorite hero and follows his philosophy and uses his values to be brave and to keep going. Sometimes is a bit impulsive with his Se but overall still a great character and I can't wait to see more from him as we all know and are looking forward too with his character. Red Riot will be a beast and awesome good hero. Here's a great post on Kirishima if you want to read more about him:&amp;#x200B;Mario - Super Mario, this is a video game character but I'll mention him here anyway. Where do I even begin, he's the biggest video game character in the world and his jumping and Se has changed the world forever in video game history. He follows his heart with his Fi and he lives to jump and perform for us as Jumpman for years to come in countless Mario games that we love to play no matter how many times we do it. His Se helps him jump and respond to details in the environment perfectly which is why he's the best debatably video game character ever made. It's Mario, he's awesome, we all now this. Let's love him and enjoy his character forever in all time.Ino - The Naruto series isn't known for developing its characters the best out of the bunch but despite this Naruto is still a great series despite its flaws and I think Ino is still a great character among the cast. She bonded really well with her team, Shikamaru and Chouji. They make a really good team and she has an interesting dynamic and rivalry with Sakura. She had a lot of good in the Chuunin Exam forest and I believe had some great fights later as well from memory. Overall Ino is a great and solid character and I felt she should be mentioned here as well.Forgive me if your a Fairy Tail fan, I'm gonna critique this one more. I don't think this next one is well written but I figured I'd mention him since he's popular:Natsu Dragoneel, one of the weaker ones for sure. Not the most well written and one of the worst shonen characters in my opinion. If you like him that's fine, I'll respect your opinion of him. But Natsu is definitely ESFP and should be mentioned here anywayRenji from Bleach, another great ESFP characterSailor Venus, another awesome ESFP characterBlack Star from Soul Eater, another great ESFP character again, hahaMajin BuuMr. 2 Bon ClayIvankovAlvida from One Piece as wellMinoru MinetaYuga AoyamaMt.

Mainly, because he has asked me about mine. I have never asked about his dating past because...idk, it‚Äôs just not important to me. But on one occasion he started giving me his ‚Äúhistory‚Äù of exes and why it didn‚Äôt work. It was odd. Like he had to get it all out or something. I was confused and asked him, what I should take from this info? Should I read into this? He said no, I shouldn‚Äôt and he was telling me just to tell me. (Ok...)The info wasn‚Äôt completely flattering to him (imo) as it sounded like he just went with people who liked him a lot. For instance he was with the latest ex because she ‚Äúreally liked him‚Äù and it ended because he realized he didn‚Äôt love her. The only person who he actively said he liked, he described as ‚Äúmean to everyone but him‚Äù and eventually that temper was what ended things.I asked him if he even knew what he wanted. I told him I was easy going with building something but I was looking for something real and didn‚Äôt want my time wasted. Took him aback. He seemed oddly pleased with that answer but didn‚Äôt say anything more. Anyway, we‚Äôre going on a trip together, his idea. Cool! Maybe it‚Äôs my own insecurity - fair admit but on another occasion he showed me some vacation pics from his travels and just lots of these different exes in them. I guess it made me uncomfortable, even though it shouldn‚Äôt? Guess I felt like it took away from the trip we had planned- like he was low key telling me it wasn‚Äôt that special.

581,1,"Hello, guys!!!A question has been bothering me that you may answer, I think: my MBTI type. I've been typed so many times as an ESFP or even an ENFP that my head hurts, and I'm still confused. Read descriptions, read accounts, could relate to Ne doms more, and didn't feel as though i am  more sensual Se dom like, I'm very very childish and flower power, ambiverted, plus a total airhead. I've been compared as a child to Belle, Angelina Jolie (who was a total role model for me) or Lara Croft, and nowadays to Melissa McCarthy in her various films, like Tammy being a great example, or to a puppy, to Hermione Granger or to the great Carrie Fisher. Is it because of the functions of a Se dom that I think I'm a Ne dom?? I'm actually very very unsure of how I work, because I don't remember what I do exactly, I always move on, although I've been told I can seem sometimes stuck and or unwilling to change, but that's a very very diffiicult subject which is pretty personal to me. I'm not sure what I do in times of stress. Sometimes I search for the loops and grips, but I don't really remember what I do. I had recently a very very unhealthy moment where I was afraid of the future, had this certain vision and I shut down, plus attacked people  INFJ-style by saying ""people are only dating and have friends because they don't know how else to raise/feed their self-esteem.I feel as though I am very honest, sometimes not, that I know I subconciously have an image that I have to keep up with, although I feel like myself, I know how the world will react, even if I want total honesty and control, which may lead to my confusion over MBTI and feeling as though I never answered honestly. Plus not knowing my effing Enneagram.Is ir possible that I am a more ENFP-ish Se dom? I just feel so down and I can't fit in no matter what description I read, so I figured I might just as well ask you guys. I can answer a lot of questions about me, in case.What do y'all think?",Might I truly be an ESFP pretending to be ENFP or just a dumbass other type? Or simply ENFP?

588,1,"I have taken the 16p AND Dario personality tests and they both come back with strong ESFP.I forgot to look at the other stuff though cause I was just trying to figure out where I belong lol.My fianc√© is a hard ENFP and he just got this book about his personality and he really wants to know mine. So he can better understand how I think.At first I thought I was a cusp of something between ESFP AND ENFP but now I see that they are particularly similar. However, there are a few things that trip me up, first is the relationships, yes I do have some flaky relationships and I HAVE hopped from one boyfriend to another but I now have found my other half. Like we literally call each other our twin. Maybe because we have a very open and honest relationship with each other and not to mention sex life is AMAZEBALLS. I digress...The other thing that I have read was ESFP personality types aren‚Äôt that creative? But I am extremely creative (arts and crafts etc.) not at all a numbers or planning person and I DEFINITELY cannot see the bigger picture in anything and it really pisses my fianc√© off sometimes lol along with my constant forgetfulness. I also love cheesy dad jokes! Like this one:What‚Äôs the difference between a hippo and a zippo lighter?Ones a little heavy the other is a little lighter LOLAlso my fianc√© does always say that I don‚Äôt listen to him and that‚Äôs not true at all. I do, I just forget things. A lot. I also roast him quite a bit which he doesn‚Äôt like either lol but he takes it and even throws some back, but when he does it he usually attacks (or seems to me) my learning disability (dyslexia) it‚Äôs usually all in fun but deep down it does sting a little.With jobs I have done various things in my life and have various degrees and certificates but none of them really brought me much joy, except for a sales job that I had but my boss was wicked chill and he knew my love language really well (words of affirmation). Something that I am interested in pursuing someday when all my other debt is paid off though is cosmetology because it‚Äôs like art, I can be creative. Another thing that didn‚Äôt totally match up is confrontation. I guess I do like to avoid confrontation with the people I care about as much as possible but if I don‚Äôt know you on a personal level or if I don‚Äôt care about you I have no problem getting into an argument or fist fight if you have hurt someone close to me. For example: If we are at the bar and my friend is being bothered by someone I will not hesitate to protect my friend, even if they don‚Äôt speak up about it and I can just tell by their body language. I have been in lots of fights this way and I don‚Äôt discriminate I WILL FIGHT YOU lol (I am female so no hate plz lol.) However, if I get in to an argument with my fianc√© (which RARELY happens) I always end up crying, and forget confrontation with my mom. I WILL not, it makes me extremely uncomfortable, I will agree with her on almost everything she says, even her extremely right wing political views (which not to mention I hate politics with a fiery passion.) I can be a little confrontational with my dad but he has always been in and out of my life so it‚Äôs kinda not the best relationship...So I guess my question is... am I an ESFP?",I think I have found my personality type... unsure though.,i have taken the 16p and dario personality test and they both come back with strong i forgot to look at the other stuff though cause i wa just trying to figure out where i belong lol my fianc√© is a hard enfp and he just got this book about his personality and he really want to know mine so he can better understand how i think at first i thought i wa a cusp of something between and enfp but now i see that they are particularly similar however there are a few thing that trip me up first is the relationship yes i do have some flaky relationship and i have hopped from one boyfriend to another but i now have found my other half like we literally call each other our twin maybe because we have a very open and honest relationship with each other and not to mention sex life is amazeballs i digress the other thing that i have read wa personality type aren‚Äôt that creative but i am extremely creative art and craft etc not at all a number or planning person and i definitely cannot see the bigger picture in anything and it really piss my fianc√© off sometimes lol along with my constant forgetfulness i also love cheesy dad joke like this one what‚Äôs the difference between a hippo and a zippo lighter one a little heavy the other is a little lighter lolalso my fianc√© doe always say that i don‚Äôt listen to him and that‚Äôs not true at all i do i just forget thing a lot i also roast him quite a bit which he doesn‚Äôt like either lol but he take it and even throw some back but when he doe it he usually attack or seems to me my learning disability dyslexia it‚Äôs usually all in fun but deep down it doe sting a little with job i have done various thing in my life and have various degree and certificate but none of them really brought me much joy except for a sale job that i had but my bos wa wicked chill and he knew my love language really well word of affirmation something that i am interested in pursuing someday when all my other debt is paid off though is cosmetology because it‚Äôs like art i can be creative another thing that didn‚Äôt totally match up is confrontation i guess i do like to avoid confrontation with the people i care about a much a possible but if i don‚Äôt know you on a personal level or if i don‚Äôt care about you i have no problem getting into an argument or fist fight if you have hurt someone close to me for example if we are at the bar and my friend is being bothered by someone i will not hesitate to protect my friend even if they don‚Äôt speak up about it and i can just tell by their body language i have been in lot of fight this way and i don‚Äôt discriminate i will fight you lol i am female so no hate plz lol however if i get in to an argument with my fianc√© which rarely happens i always end up cry and forget confrontation with my mom i will not it make me extremely uncomfortable i will agree with her on almost everything she say even her extremely right wing political view which not to mention i hate politics with a fiery passion i can be a little confrontational with my dad but he ha always been in and out of my life so it‚Äôs kinda not the best relationship so i guess my question is am i an i think i have found my personality type unsure though,3186,632,0.115,0.169,0.716,0.9928

600,1,"TL;DR - INTJ visiting looking for some help, or at least perspective, trying to make my marriage of 17 years with ESFP work.Note: We have both had individual (frequently) and couple counseling (periodically) throughout our marriage.\---------------So, first off, I want to say that I love my wife and think that she's a wonderful person. She alternates between ESFP and ENFP and I recognize both types in her.¬† I love her energy and enthusiasm in exploring new ideas and experiences with me!¬† She is often remarkably compassionate and selfless with our kids.¬† Her willingness to challenge my beliefs/thinking and to advocate for me and my wellbeing when I struggle to do so for myself are invaluable.From what I understand of ESFPs, this may not be a very popular post, but I'm hoping you can help me communicate better with my wife. We've got a lot of circumstances working against us. This year has not been kind to us financially, with my worsening health threatening my ability to work (as a workaholic trying to do better), many thousands of dollars of medical bills mounting trying to find a diagnosis/treatment, and $10k+ of fraud and theft from our renovation contractor.My wife, as gracious as she is, can be really¬† one-sided or even petty when she talks to others about people she is upset with, particularly if she feels that they have crossed her or rejected her in some way.¬† Sooner or later she gets really upset with me and our marriage.Don't get me wrong, I make lots of mistakes and do/say things that make me hard to live with sometimes. The only real mitigating factor is that I really do try to never be an asshole, am genuinely open to criticism, and work hard to change behavior and even attitudes once I understand the effect of what I'm doing or saying. Change is hard and isn't immediate, especially if I don't understand what the issue is or how to change it at first, but I do change. I'm grateful that she's helped me learn how to be a better person through our conflicts.So, here's the thing, whenever this happens she tells me that it happened because she was talking with someone else who told her she was being mistreated, and then when she thinks back on some past interactions she gets really angry.¬† I've come to recognize that I suck at picking up on emotional cues, so this always blindsides me.¬† I've tried asking her periodically how she's feeling or if she's happy in our marriage, but even days before the blow-up she responds that she's happy. Additionally, asking seems to annoy her, particularly if there is any frequency.Another major communication barrier is that when I try to talk with her to find a resolution to a disagreement, she often feels like I'm being manipulative or dismisses my perspective out of hand as being unrealistic or otherwise invalid.¬†I am typically very open to the possibility that I'm wrong, and am even grateful for being proven wrong so that I can start being ""not-wrong."" I honestly don't feel like I'm trying to be manipulative.¬†Because I don't understand what I can change in my approach to be effective, I've come to feel like I don't have a voice in our marriage and end up constantly sacrificing my needs and aspirations to help support her being in another play, getting a new pet, etc.¬† Don't get me wrong, I love to see her shine, but eventually my inner, emotional self rebels against my overwhelmed logical exterior and I blow up. I don't yell or call her names, but I get angry and critical of what she's done (or not done) that I feel pushed me over my stress limit. I inherited an instinctive scowl from my dad (that is REALLY hard for me to control) that can, in itself, be abusive.How do you get through these kinds of hurdles?

603,1,"Wanted to post some really great anime ESFPs that I think truly are ESFP in my opinion. You probably already guessed and noticing some ESFP and ENFP confusion online since you guys look so alike from each other and everyone has their own opinions which is fine. But I wanted to do this today and share my personal opinion on anime characters that I see that are definitely ESFPs in my opinion and are great and amazing characters as well and very well written too. You guys complain for good reason that the MBTI community doesn't do you justice and stereotypes you guys too often and get prejudged a lot by stereotypes you guys are known for and I feel you.So I wanted to do this post as a thanks for being awesome and discussion of what anime characters I think are ESFPs for sure and are great characters as well in the anime community. Now I'm gonna get this out of the way, I'll share my opinion on the big ones that people debate often for anime main characters that get debated ENFP vs ESFP in the community. In my opinion I type Goku, Gon Freecss, Luffy, and Naruto ENFPs, I feel they've shown Ne and Si each plenty of times to argue the case for each one and make the case for why their each individually ENFPs. That's my opinion though, if you agree or disagree feel free to share your opinions down below. I'll posts links to posts I've made on them or other people's post on them that I agree with if you want to see evidence for why I think so for each character. I personally see Ash Ketchum ENFP too but that's my opinion as well. Share your opinions down below again if you feel you want to or feel differently about something, I'll post the links down below. But this post isn't about them, it's about other characters that I see in my opinion as awesome ESFPs and great characters that people already know and love or need to talk about more and give more love and attention to and should recognize as awesome ESFP characters, alright enough with the essay I'll post my opinions down below now:My Goku ENFP opinion and analysis:[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku\_is\_an\_enfp\_and\_heres\_why\_dragon\_ball\_z\_mbti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/czk51q/goku_is_an_enfp_and_heres_why_dragon_ball_z_mbti/)My Gon Freecss ENFP post:[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/d7pprz/why\_gon\_freecs\_is\_enfp\_and\_uses\_ne\_primarily\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/d7pprz/why_gon_freecs_is_enfp_and_uses_ne_primarily_over/)A Luffy post I agree with, Me and my ISFJ friend are working on a Luffy ENFP post now together for Reddit, it should be out soon but here's this for now:[https://practicaltyping.com/2018/08/31/monkey-d-luffy-enfp/](https://practicaltyping.com/2018/08/31/monkey-d-luffy-enfp/)Naruto, surprisingly I haven't done a Naruto post yet but I know he's ENFP in my opinion and I've been watching the anime again and I see his Ne and Si in the first 7 episodes, I'm gonna make a Naruto post in time once I finish my rewatch and reread so until then I'll just link this post I agree with, tell me what you think on it if you want:[https://fictionalcharactermbti.tumblr.com/post/160992147849/hello-i-always-agreed-with-your-typing-of-naruto](https://fictionalcharactermbti.tumblr.com/post/160992147849/hello-i-always-agreed-with-your-typing-of-naruto)Now for the awesome characters I see as clear ESFPs in my opinion, here's my list of all them written out for you guys:Awesome ESFP anime characters:Kuwabara - This man is amazing and one of my favorite anime characters of all time. He's fantastic and relatable and very funny and down to Earth. He has a heart of gold and great morality and has a awesome dynamic between him and Yusuke who's ESTP. Kuwabara is sometimes mistyped ESFJ but no this man is ESFP for sure, he uses Se and Fi all the thime and he's an awesome ESFP anime character at that. Overall great character, gonna make a character analysis on him when the time comes when I get to rewatching Yu Yu Hakusho again.Knuckle - Another great Kuwabara like character, made by Togashi again. Very manly and tough but has a soft side that the show often gets on him for and its very funny side to his character. Again heart of gold and great morality, he loves animals, he helps Gon out even though Gon got mad at him for it, haha. Knuckle is great what more do I need to say, he's an amazing character and one of Togashi's best.Brook - One of the best straw hats from One Piece. One of the best characters in One Piece as well. Most people agree on this, he's amazing and extremely creative idea on Oda's part. He's a talking skeleton with an Afro with a extremely sad backstory but still keeps his sense of humor and is very down to earth as well. He loves to perform and make music and make people laugh and make jokes. He's more practical than Luffy which is a nice touch and is realistic and loyal to Luffy and Laboon. He make his own band and music artist career of sorts which is amazing and hilarious at the same time. He was incredible in the New World especially in the Big Mom arc, anyone that seen the arc knows what I'm talking about. It's Brook what more do I need to say, Soul King will live on forever.Mina Ashido - One of the more newer ones, she's spontaneous and in the moment and loves to dance and party. She likes to break dance and get involved in class activities and likes to get everyone else involved as well in the fun. She's bright and energetic and full of life and has a interesting and unique design to her. Love Mina she's a great character and one of the best characters in class 1-A.Joey Wheeler - Now where do I begin. This guy is a fantastic character and probably started the heart of gold ESFP stereotype first before among all of them. Joey is an awesome character with great morality and tons of funny humor to him as a character as well, its true he started off a bully to Yugi but once they changed and Yugi helped him he never left his side and stayed loyal to him till the end. Joey is great an amazing character and I always loved when he was on screen and the duels he was apart of in the series.Ty Lee - from Avatar she's a rather interesting one. She seems one note at first and just attractive and all that initially. But as the series progressed we learn more about her and her backstory and learn to empathize with her more rather than our first initial impression of her in the beginning when they were around the campfire. She might not seem to important of a character among the cast to some people out of all the Avatar cast but I felt her character was done well enough to mention her here so here you go, Ty Lee is among the greats.Asta - Another newer one from Black Clover. I think Asta is an interesting case for a character so far. I haven't gotten too far in Black Clover so I don't have too much to say about him but from what I've seen I'm starting to like his character more and can see his determination and drive to reach his goals and do whatever it takes to get to where he wants to be to be Wizard King. He's shaping up to be great and more interesting so I wanted to mention him here since I feel he deserved it and it was necessary.Mario - Super Mario, this is a video game character but I'll mention him here anyway. Where do I even begin, he's the biggest video game character in the world and his jumping and Se has changed the world forever in video game history. He follows his heart with his Fi and he lives to jump and perform for us as Jumpman for years to come in countless Mario games that we love to play no matter how many times we do it. His Se helps him jump and respond to details in the environment perfectly which is why he's the best debatably video game character ever made. It's Mario, he's awesome, we all now this. Let's love him and enjoy his character forever in all time.Ino - The Naruto series isn't known for developing its characters the best out of the bunch but despite this Naruto is still a great series despite its flaws and I think Ino is still a great character among the cast. She bonded really well with her team, Shikamaru and Chouji. They make a really good team and she has an interesting dynamic and rivalry with Sakura. She had a lot of good in the Chuunin Exam forest and I believe had some great fights later as well from memory. Overall Ino is a great and solid character and I felt she should be mentioned here as well.Mention anymore down below if you feel I missed any. I'll probably add more to the list in time too myself.

I feel this deep connection to the emotional significance of art, and the different perspectives on the world offered up by history stoke my imagination and curiosity. I think she experiences a somewhat different version of delight, though the exact nature of it eludes me...We have a deep affection for one another, but it's still hard for us to connect at surface level sometimes. I tend to try to connect to others by sharing feelings and innermost thoughts, and she has trouble relating to that. She likes to keep things light. I think it's important for me to take her affection for granted, although she doesn't always show it in ways that I expect. Our biggest hurdle is that she prefers to avoid direct confrontation and pushes down her feelings to keep things fun and light. I can't read the nonverbal cues she gives when she's bothered, and I continue bothering her! We've been discussing this lately, and I'd love to hear any suggestions about how to be a friend that better suits her personality.Keep being beautiful ESFPs, and thanks for reading!",ESFPs and Intuitives,hello lovely s you guy are great inxj here big fan i ve been friend with an awesome for year now and i thought it would be interesting to talk about both the complexity of xnxx relationship i d love to hear your thought i ve never had a better adventure buddy than my friend we ve travelled all over the world together and her spontaneity enthusiasm and present ness are a great complement to my eagerness to explore the new and different a a j i help make our plan a bit easier to execute and a a p she help me be more flexible a is often needed we both love the art and history so we go to the opera and museum and watch documentary together i feel this deep connection to the emotional significance of art and the different perspective on the world offered up by history stoke my imagination and curiosity i think she experience a somewhat different version of delight though the exact nature of it eludes me we have a deep affection for one another but it s still hard for u to connect at surface level sometimes i tend to try to connect to others by sharing s and innermost thought and she ha trouble relating to that she like to keep thing light i think it s important for me to take her affection for granted although she doesn t always show it in way that i expect our biggest hurdle is that she prefers to avoid direct confrontation and push down her s to keep thing fun and light i can t read the nonverbal cue she give when she s bothered and i continue bothering her we ve been discussing this lately and i d love to hear any suggestion about how to be a friend that better suit her personality keep being beautiful s and thanks for reading s and s,1660,323,0.049,0.227,0.725,0.9961

609,1,"Hi, so I'm an ENFP and I've been really good friends with an ESFP girl (I'm a guy) for 2 years now. I've always though she was really beautiful and we get along super well, and I think while I've been denying it to myself, I may have had a crush on her for awhile now. And tbh I'm not sure what to do about it, and a lot would depend on how she felt. She's def my best female friend and I'd be happy keeping it that way if I thought that was for the best, but I've always wondered if I might surprisingly have a chance with her, for quite a lot of reasons. So early on when I knew her, she stumbled into my room drunk, wanted us to go hang out on my bed, and said something about whether I wanted to do something unexpected, but at that point she was only a friend to me so I didn't think it was worth finding out what exactly that all meant. Idk if thats just standard ESFP behavior but at the time I felt pretty sure where that all was headed. She's literally told me she tends to go for taller thiner guys, in other words me to a t, so I guess that helps too.Despite me being more shy than most extraverts she's tried to get me to do things with her, which I love as it gets me out of my comfort zones and makes having fun way easier. If I actually want to just hang out with her, however, I always have had to be the one reaching out, until more recently (before the virus) when she finally started reaching out too. We also go out to parties together quite a lot especially recently, we both love drunk/high dancing so much. One thing thats happened a couple of times is we'll just be dancing and she'll be like ""just pretend to be my bf"" and then she'll kiss me a bunch (only on the cheek I think), always saying that she's warding off interested guys. For most people that would be a sign if it happens a few times, I think, but with her who knows. I mean she does like to use people as human pillows whenever possible so she doesn't exactly shy away from random physical contact. She's always been super straightforward with guys, but also really shies away from anything like real feelings, which maybe doesn't help me much?  Anyways, there a few things here that always made me think about what she meant by them, and whether that was just something reflecting her personality, or if it meant more, and I figured you guys might have some ideas as ESFPs. And thanks if u took the time to read this big mess of randomness, its much appreciated!","hey ESFP's, do I have a chance here and whats going on?",hi so i m an enfp and i ve been really good friend with an girl i m a guy for 2 year now i ve always though she wa really beautiful and we get along super well and i think while i ve been denying it to myself i may have had a crush on her for awhile now and tbh i m not sure what to do about it and a lot would depend on how she felt she s def my best female friend and i d be happy keeping it that way if i thought that wa for the best but i ve always wondered if i might surprisingly have a chance with her for quite a lot of reason so early on when i knew her she stumbled into my room drunk wanted u to go hang out on my bed and said something about whether i wanted to do something unexpected but at that point she wa only a friend to me so i didn t think it wa worth finding out what exactly that all meant idk if thats just standard behavior but at the time i felt pretty sure where that all wa headed she s literally told me she tends to go for taller thiner guy in other word me to a t so i guess that help too despite me being more shy than most extravert she s tried to get me to do thing with her which i love a it get me out of my comfort zone and make having fun way easier if i actually want to just hang out with her however i always have had to be the one reaching out until more recently before the virus when she finally started reaching out too we also go out to party together quite a lot especially recently we both love drunk high dancing so much one thing thats happened a couple of time is we ll just be dancing and she ll be like just pretend to be my bf and then she ll kiss me a bunch only on the cheek i think always saying that she s warding off interested guy for most people that would be a sign if it happens a few time i think but with her who know i mean she doe like to use people a human pillow whenever possible so she doesn t exactly shy away from random physical contact she s always been super straightforward with guy but also really shy away from anything like real s which maybe doesn t help me much anyways there a few thing here that always made me think about what she meant by them and whether that wa just something reflecting her personality or if it meant more and i figured you guy might have some idea a s and thanks if u took the time to read this big mess of randomness it much appreciated hey s do i have a chance here and whats going on,2393,508,0.043,0.187,0.77,0.9981

Not to say I‚Äôm a psychopath, because I can tell you I cry at anything that makes me happy, sad, or angry real easily. But I just don‚Äôt think I understand the concept of love, which has just become this belief that I can‚Äôt love.In my last (and honestly, only,) true relationship, I flung around ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù like it was nothing. But when it boiled down to some of our arguments (consisting of my INTP ex boyfriend constantly berating himself and me trying to assure him that I loved him,) I took a step back eventually and really thought about the weight of the phrase.And I realized that I didn‚Äôt love him. Which is crazy because I just said I don‚Äôt know what love is like, but I know I didn‚Äôt love him because I started growing impatient and tired of having to pick him up on a daily basis. (Its really terrible of me to say that, but that is what I felt because even if I had a rough day, I always had to shift my focus away from myself.) On top of that, I realized that I didn‚Äôt feel any spark when I was with him, and (a bit TMI but whatever,) kissing just felt bland. Boring.Nowadays I have a lot of superficial crushes based off of appearance and occasional levels of attention the other gives me. I usually get over it because I just realize that I don‚Äôt genuinely like/love them like that. Do you think it‚Äôs because I have yet to experience love? I know ESFPs are stereotyped to be people who are frequently bored and prefer not to commit to one thing, so is that coming into play here?I‚Äôd love to hear any experiences or advice out there :,) I haven‚Äôt really confessed this to my friends, but I felt like the capability to be anonymous here is what‚Äôs helping me out",Feeling Love?,hello i‚Äôm a baby when it come to reddit and knowing that i‚Äôm an so i would love to hear others‚Äô perspective here to put it bluntly i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm capable of love not to say i‚Äôm a psychopath because i can tell you i cry at anything that make me happy sad or angry real easily but i just don‚Äôt think i understand the concept of love which ha just become this belief that i can‚Äôt love in my last and honestly only true relationship i flung around ‚Äúi love you ‚Äù like it wa nothing but when it boiled down to some of our argument consisting of my intp ex boyfriend constantly berating himself and me trying to assure him that i loved him i took a step back eventually and really thought about the weight of the phrase and i realized that i didn‚Äôt love him which is crazy because i just said i don‚Äôt know what love is like but i know i didn‚Äôt love him because i started growing impatient and tired of having to pick him up on a daily basis it really terrible of me to say that but that is what i felt because even if i had a rough day i always had to shift my focus away from myself on top of that i realized that i didn‚Äôt feel any spark when i wa with him and a bit tmi but whatever kissing just felt bland boring nowadays i have a lot of superficial crush based off of appearance and occasional level of attention the other give me i usually get over it because i just realize that i don‚Äôt genuinely like love them like that do you think it‚Äôs because i have yet to experience love i know s are stereotyped to be people who are frequently bored and prefer not to commit to one thing so is that coming into play here i‚Äôd love to hear any experience or advice out there i haven‚Äôt really confessed this to my friend but i felt like the capability to be anonymous here is what‚Äôs helping me out love,1792,359,0.08,0.263,0.658,0.9984

I told this friend I have that people would like her a lot more if she was more of a down person.There has been another time too with a different friend who I'm no longer friends with where it was always a struggle getting her to do things with me because she wasn't a down person. Anyway, I was talking to my friend who I don't see that often anymore. I told her that I don't like how most of the time when we hang out, we're always doing the same stuff that we did in the past. This stuff includes either going to each others' house to watch movies and bake, grab a drink around the mall and just walk around, or get lunch/dinner at a restaurant and chat.My friend said that she's more of an introvert who prefers doing simpler things. I then told her that it's mostly just dependent on whether or not she wants to go out and do different things. She didn't have much to say to this part, so I stopped talking about it for a bit. However I was still thinking about all the friends I have and how none of them are down to do things that are more fun like rave, party, go to clubs, bar hop, travel, go on road trips, and hit up Vegas.Since I was getting annoyed thinking about this, I decided to ask that same friend if she ever feels like life is just passing her by. She repeated again that she's just really simple, so she prefers staying home or just doing relaxing things if she does go out with friends.I mentioned that to me it seems like if people aren't going out an experiencing a bunch of fun things, it's like their life is just passing by with nothing meaningful like it's a waste.

701,1,"I am sharing this here because I am really interested on the type of response that I may get and also unloading my conscience. This at the expense of exposure, which hurts but the lesson is more valuable than pain so here it goes: I am in a tight spot in my life right now. I don¬¥t know if I can pay next month¬¥s rent. I left my country in an attempt to put my life back in order. I am struggling to finally put my health on check.   Today I got a little breather from the stress and suddenly a lot of emotional baggage I have been neglecting came rushing back. The last 4 hours I have been emotionally introspecting and talking to myself seriously, like a father voices his concerns to a son. I have been introspecting about my past relations with my friends and how selfish I was. Selfish to the point I could not see how these friends of mine related to other people. I just cared about me and them. everyone else was in the way. I got to the point why I was being selfish. I was using them to satisfy my social needs in return they would satisfy theirs. Being solely focused on hour hobbies, that was all we could satisfy. But I was always waiting for the relationship to become something more than that. I think that I would rather become more attached to someone rather than to find someone else.  In attempts to make stronger bonds I quickly realized resistance from their part. After trying multiple times I soon got over it. But still I was not finding reliable substitutes for these people, so I stayed by their side. I never was socially savvy, my best bet was to wait for them to change. Obviously that never happened. Meanwhile we were enabling each other to live or teenage lives with each other. Our meetings were that time when we could get out our awkward personality without being judged. Years passed, we were still meeting ritualistically. I always stayed near my parents house but most of my friends went abroad to study or work. I feel that ,for them, our meetings were just a nice throwback to spice life a little bit. But for me it was different. I still regarded this people as my best friends, despite only seeing them a couple weeks per year. I got stuck on getting closer to them, while they clearly got away from me.After some testing to see if they would notice absence, my emotional inner child was convinced this people did not mean much to me anymore. I was alone for years without realizing. With no friends and a bad relationship with my stepdad I decided to leave my country and commit social suicide. I have met a lot of people besides my friends but I never regarded them as my friends because I had my ""real friends"" coming next summer. After all, I had no significant relations with anybody because my heart was filled with this hollow memories of the past. Holding on the the idea of friends because I was afraid of looking for new pals.Here I am, all alone, writing this, poking a social network to see if it jerks. I hope this has made you think about the space you have in your heart. It is not limited and you have to organize and clean it up before you put something new in it. I have my conclusion of all of this, but I think it would egotistical to not let you think about your own conclusion as well.Find some peace of mind and clean your heart,  JC",Time for feels,i am sharing this here because i am really interested on the type of response that i may get and also unloading my conscience this at the expense of exposure which hurt but the lesson is more valuable than pain so here it go i am in a tight spot in my life right now i don¬¥t know if i can pay next month¬¥s rent i left my country in an attempt to put my life back in order i am struggling to finally put my health on check today i got a little breather from the stress and suddenly a lot of emotional baggage i have been neglecting came rushing back the last 4 hour i have been emotionally introspecting and talking to myself seriously like a father voice his concern to a son i have been introspecting about my past relation with my friend and how selfish i wa selfish to the point i could not see how these friend of mine related to other people i just cared about me and them everyone else wa in the way i got to the point why i wa being selfish i wa using them to satisfy my social need in return they would satisfy theirs being solely focused on hour hobby that wa all we could satisfy but i wa always waiting for the relationship to become something more than that i think that i would rather become more attached to someone rather than to find someone else in attempt to make stronger bond i quickly realized resistance from their part after trying multiple time i soon got over it but still i wa not finding reliable substitute for these people so i stayed by their side i never wa socially savvy my best bet wa to wait for them to change obviously that never happened meanwhile we were enabling each other to live or teenage life with each other our meeting were that time when we could get out our awkward personality without being judged year passed we were still meeting ritualistically i always stayed near my parent house but most of my friend went abroad to study or work i feel that for them our meeting were just a nice throwback to spice life a little bit but for me it wa different i still regarded this people a my best friend despite only seeing them a couple week per year i got stuck on getting closer to them while they clearly got away from me after some testing to see if they would notice absence my emotional inner child wa convinced this people did not mean much to me anymore i wa alone for year without realizing with no friend and a bad relationship with my stepdad i decided to leave my country and commit social suicide i have met a lot of people besides my friend but i never regarded them a my friend because i had my real friend coming next summer after all i had no significant relation with anybody because my heart wa filled with this hollow memory of the past holding on the the idea of friend because i wa afraid of looking for new pal here i am all alone writing this poking a social network to see if it jerk i hope this ha made you think about the space you have in your heart it is not limited and you have to organize and clean it up before you put something new in it i have my conclusion of all of this but i think it would egotistical to not let you think about your own conclusion a well find some peace of mind and clean your heart jctime for feel,3198,623,0.086,0.181,0.733,0.9978

Even then, she still tries to stop at nothing until she achieves her goals. * Although she looks like someone who's afraid of nothing and tough, she's not as fearless and strong as people perceive her. She admitted that she's scared that she hasn't worked hard enough, that there are things she hasn't completed perfectly, and that she has disappointed everyone who likes her by not meeting their expectations. * She used to barely have any friends at all because she was afraid of getting hurt and she's on the shyer side.

On her birthday every year, she would feel sad, lonely, and anxious because she wouldn't have anyone who would celebrate it with her. * Even though she wants to have a lot of friends since she's never had many and has always been a lone-wolf type of girl, she's definitely an introvert who enjoys staying at home.* She's pretty good at putting up a front when she's about to cry. However there are times where it's quite easy to see she's almost going to cry. Sometimes her mood flips within seconds, such as this one time where she was laughing then heard a comment. Immediately her mood flipped and you could see her lip trembling and her eyes starting to water. However the person expanded on their comment and said it was a joke then she immediately started smiling widely again. * She likes putting a twist on things and making them different. For example, she enjoys singing but when doing a cover of a song, she likes putting her own spin on it to make the cover a little different. * She claims that she's fast-paced and impatient. I don't really see it, but I suppose she could be on the impatient side. * She wants to bring everyone positivity and happiness. She tries to ignore anyone who dislikes her because she wants to stay happy and hopes everyone else is happy too.* Pressure helps motivate her * She can enjoy compliments just like everyone else can, but what she cares most about is criticism. Once someone criticizes her, she puts all her focus on that and tries her best to improve. She can be pretty hard on herself.* She says she's a straightforward person; however, she's more gentle depending on who the person is. For example, she's less straightforward with some of her softer friends because she's afraid she could possibly hurt their feelings, which she doesn't want to do.* She knows how to cut hair and has spent a lot of time cutting other friends' hair too. She enjoys doing her nails and makeup. She has dyed her hair a shade of pink before and currently has burgundy hair.* Very non-judgmental; she can be friends with anybody and doesn't care about what they do or what they like. * She once said something about not being the same person you originally were after going through a rainstorm, and that she hopes people can know her as someone with more possibilities.","ESFP, ISFP, ESTJ, something else?",i can t figure out my friend s type look very cold and unapproachable at first impression she doesn t speak much and hardly initiate meeting a person first however once you get to know her a little longer she ll slowly begin to show her real side she s actually a really playful silly girl who laugh at almost everything and enjoys joking around with people she s a bit reserved and struggle with acting cute or cheesy although it s very against the culture where she life to the point of it being a taboo she got many piercings and tattoo at the age of 15 she ha her entire back tattooed with something she designed on her own she enjoys drawing and is very good at it she also love singing writing her own song playing the guitar acting and dancing she initially majored in art while in college before switching to some sort of communication major her dream is to become a famous singer and she said she ll never stop chasing after her dream and what she want in life extremely hard working and focused on her goal her discipline is really good and she work hard to the point of tiring out her own body and getting stressed even then she still try to stop at nothing until she achieves her goal although she look like someone who s afraid of nothing and tough she s not a fearless and strong a people perceive her she admitted that she s scared that she hasn t worked hard enough that there are thing she hasn t completed perfectly and that she ha disappointed everyone who like her by not meeting their expectation she used to barely have any friend at all because she wa afraid of getting hurt and she s on the shyer side although she barely had friend she always wished that she could have a lot of friend on her birthday every year she would feel sad lonely and anxious because she wouldn t have anyone who would celebrate it with her even though she want to have a lot of friend since she s never had many and ha always been a lone wolf type of girl she s definitely an introvert who enjoys staying at home she s pretty good at putting up a front when she s about to cry however there are time where it s quite easy to see she s almost going to cry sometimes her mood flip within second such a this one time where she wa laughing then heard a comment immediately her mood flipped and you could see her lip trembling and her eye starting to water however the person expanded on their comment and said it wa a joke then she immediately started smiling widely again she like putting a twist on thing and making them different for example she enjoys singing but when doing a cover of a song she like putting her own spin on it to make the cover a little different she claim that she s fast paced and impatient i don t really see it but i suppose she could be on the impatient side she want to bring everyone positivity and happiness she try to ignore anyone who dislike her because she want to stay happy and hope everyone else is happy too pressure help motivate her she can enjoy compliment just like everyone else can but what she care most about is criticism once someone criticizes her she put all her focus on that and try her best to improve she can be pretty hard on herself she say she s a straightforward person however she s more gentle depending on who the person is for example she s le straightforward with some of her softer friend because she s afraid she could possibly hurt their s which she doesn t want to do she know how to cut hair and ha spent a lot of time cutting other friend hair too she enjoys doing her nail and makeup she ha dyed her hair a shade of pink before and currently ha burgundy hair very non judgmental she can be friend with anybody and doesn t care about what they do or what they like she once said something about not being the same person you originally were after going through a rainstorm and that she hope people can know her a someone with more possibility isfp estj something else,3933,755,0.068,0.208,0.724,0.9989

733,1,"I'm a university student and I just finished my first year... it was super rough. And there's at least 7 more years of this to come. I recently just figured out I was an ESFP and didn't even realize all these cool things about my personality that never shawn because I've been depressed and anxious for the last 11 years. In high school, I had trouble concentrating and focusing on the task at hand, I'd get bored, it would take me forever to complete the task, I would procrastinate to the max, make careless mistakes, would get easily distracted, had trouble committing to things due to short attention span... these were indicative of inattentive ADHD according to my psychiatrist, so I tried an ADHD med. It make me dumber, crazy, and extremely emotional. So I stopped that one and tried another one. The other one did nothing. Tried another one. It made me anxious and gave me heart palpitations. Tried another one. Did nothing, and now I was out of options.Conclusion: 4 ADHD medications tried, nothing worked; I didn't have ADHD and no one knew what my problem was. I thought maybe it was depression and anxiety that made me like this, and maybe that's true, but recently I've been feeling a lot better and have had a much more optimistic view of life (this is not to say I'm cured , it doesn't work that way, but I may be on a good path) and I don't spend most of my days in bed anymore! So I found out I was an ESFP not too long ago (it's so spot on it's kinda creepy), and two of the flaws suggest that we are unfocused and easily bored. That is literally one of my biggest problems - I always end up doing what I want to do in any given moment (and it's usually wayyy more fun than what I should be doing) Or if I do sit down and study, I get distracted with small details like making my notes look perfect and aesthetically pleasing, so I often rewrite things and that takes a considerable amount of time out of my study time. And then I get bored, so I tell myself its time to take a break. Then I get buried into the other thing I'm doing during my break. My time management skills are shit, but I was able to coast through high school cause it wasn't too difficult for me but university was a shit show! And I'm aiming for professional programs so the next several years are going into schooling, but I have to do really well in school if I wanna graduate and have a career :')So I'm asking, how have you guys managed to make yourselves stay focused? I think that might be the biggest thing I need to work on, cause if I remain focused I'll get it done quicker. Sorry for the big wall of text! TL;DR: I have trouble staying focused, following through with a plan for the day because I just end up doing whatever I want, and it takes me forever to do something probably because I try really hard to make it look nice rather than actually getting it done (this is most applicable to taking notes - I spend more time making it look pretty rather than learning the material). These have affected my school performance because I have no time management skills and some of the ESFP flaws are uncontrolled on my part. There's several more years of schooling for me and I need to find a way to fix these and would love some tips from you guys!","Any ESFPs studying for a long time?

750,1,"Hi everyone! I'm Derek (ENTJ). My friends and I just recently launched an MBTI based dating app called Boo, but have gotten thousands of sign ups already. After much tweaking, we finally wanted to share this with you in the hopes that this may help you find like-minded friends and loved ones.We felt like current dating apps were really inefficient. They help you meet more people, not more of the right people. This means wasted time, money, and emotional preparation on bad dates with no chemistry. It's not just bad dates; the time and effort from swiping, messaging, arranging dates, and preparing both emotionally and physically, just for dates to continuously not work out, has led to dating fatigue and the sense that online dating is hopeless. It's also hard to tell what a person is actually like through text, only to be disappointed after meeting or the first month of dating.What we as MBTI enthusiasts have always known is that who we are (personality type) tends to influence the kinds of people we're attracted to, and it doesn't make sense for this not to play a part in mainstream online dating.We wanted to create a radically authentic, transparent, and empathetic dating experience where people can feel free to be themselves, because it is exactly by being yourself that the right person will come along and like and appreciate you for who you naturally are. On Boo, if someone matched with you, they‚Äôre already aware of your best and worst traits, and still decided they‚Äôd rather have you over any other type. On Boo, you‚Äôre already what each other are looking for.As an ESFP, you're the life of the party; there's never a dull moment with you. You also have great aesthetic tastes and people skills. But at your worst, you're not a great long term planner, tend to engage in risky behavior, and overengage in self-indulgement. You‚Äôll want someone who sees the world as you do and loves you for your best, but also understands and forgives you at your worst, and would have it no other way.

756,1,"Hi! I'm an ENTP and I'd really like to get to know the other types better, especially ESFPs. Lately though, I've been having a bit of trouble. Bit of background: I used to have severe depression/anxiety/PTSD issues, so my parents sent me to a residential program. Turns out, if you group a bunch of people with a wide variety of issues together, the environment gets pretty toxic. Who knew? Long story short, the two ESFPs there would antagonize me and some of my friends. One would make subtle(ish) underhanded remarks about being creeped out by my bisexuality and steal my belongings, then claim that I was lying. AND I shared a room with her, where she would walk around naked, but would make remarks whenever I tried to change my shirt (""Can you put those away? We're all straight here, so you can stop""). This situation is incredibly unfortunate, because those were the only confirmed ESFPs I've known in my life, which leads me to the possibility that maybe it wasn't them, it was me.I've always worked hard to see things from multiple points of view and be a good listener and friend. If I've ever had an issue with anyone, I've always been able to talk it through with them. But for some reason, whatever I did just didn't work with them. So I'm wondering if there's some form of communication that I'm lacking. I feel really guilty about it, and super worried that it might happen with someone else. It's been half a year since it happened, but I still can't get it out of my head.Of course, I might just be overthinking. They might just be plain old mean, or homophobic, or just going through a rough time. But either way, I don't want to make anyone feel angry or disgusted.

760,1,"\*\* not judging anyone that does want these things!\*\* I realize I'm probably the odd one out (I'm female)I'm just curious if any other women feel this way. I got out of a long term relationship recently and I'm realizing I don't think I ever want to be married. I'm not interested in being in a long term relationship either. Not because the relationship was dysfunctional or anything, it was normal, fairly healthy, no abuse and he treated me with respect etc. I'm finding I miss the movie watching, talking, physical things but not the actual relationship status.I guess when I think about it, it just makes me sad to think anyone is voluntarily spending any time on this planet being unhappy voluntarily, and it seems like there are SO many unhappy married people who stay because they made a commitment. I know there are happy ones too! But it seems like there are far less.And I think you should try honor that commitment, but  I guess to me, why make it in the first place if there's a chance you just won't love each other anymore at some point and you know you made a promise to stay and be unhappy?

One of my best friends is an ESFP and she is amazing! You're guaranteed to have fun when she's around and she's also very insightful. The app has only just become available in the app stores (iOS and Android), but we've had thousands of sign ups already.Firstly, we wanted to let you know about it because we thought it might be of interest. We've had lots of people get in touch to say they are having some amazing conversations and they've never connected with such great people on a dating app. Most people aren't meeting up in person at the moment due to coronavirus, and of course, safety comes first, but the app usage has gone through the roof as people get to know each other better online and make meaningful connections.Secondly, we are refining the UI/UX at the moment and we'd really appreciate any feedback (either on here or at [hello@sosyncd.com](mailto:hello@sosyncd.com)).It's totally free to sign up and it only takes a couple of minutes to do so, if you know your personality type already, which you guys obviously do! You also have the option of searching for specific personality types.

Just the one you like the most.**For example**:  I am Enfp and I like XXXX, XXXX and XXXX the most \----&gt; you don¬¥t need to explain *why* you like them the mostSince the mbti community has 88k Members and the Enfp community alone has 42k members, I decided that I would post this post on each subreddit of each type because I want as much answers as possible.

884,1,"* My main concern in life is being girly and chic. I hate anything perceived as masculine, such as playing sports, watching competitive things, playing video games, wearing dark colors, listening to rap music, and other things. I like watching fashion vlogs, makeup tutorials, singing, dancing, shopping, taking selfies, and other things along those lines. My career goal is to become a visual merchandiser for a high-end designer brand like Chanel. * In school, I'm pretty lazy and don't care about my grades as long as I pass. I just want to do the bare minimum. I find cheating on exams fun, usually copy other people's work, have gotten truancy letters, and have failed a couple classes. Group members have had a problem with me for free-riding, but I always just dismiss them with a sassy reply. I'm uninterested in getting to know my classmates because as shallow as it sounds, I don't care to befriend anyone unless I find them girly and pretty because I want friends I share common interests with. * I come across bitchy and cold, partially because I barely speak or smile. I don't care about the haters at all and I'm known to have an attitude. I've sassed many customers at work and I'm quite blunt, so it's not rare for people to have an issue with me. In the first place, I barely work anyway because I just want free time to do things I enjoy.* My biggest fear is becoming fat and manly because those are things I really can't stand on other people. I have to be as girly and skinny as possible. I'm not interested in dating, but if I were to date, I'd want a guy to spoil me with gifts, treat me like I'm a queen, and do things my way. I have expensive taste and like the finer things in life. I think expensive designer items like Chanel, YSL, Celine, Prada, Louis Vuitton and more are so gorgeous and I aspire to collect many of these items to make people jealous. Also even though I don't drink, I think going to expensive, fancy restaurants with champagne and expensive red wine is classy and chic. One of my friend's mom has many designer items, loves fine dining, and lives an extravagant life. I wish she was my mom instead. I love the Kylie Jenner lifestyle, minus her body because she's plastic. I hate surgery. My ideal place to travel is anywhere people view as classy, chic, and girly like Paris.* My idol is Ariana Grande because she's so girly and successful, yet she's still a feminist who knows her worth and will put people in their place for disrespecting her. Even though I barely speak, I also really like attention and praise. If I'm feeling more extroverted, I sometimes will talk a lot but if the conversation isn't in my interest, I don't want to speak at all.* I hate having my picture taken because I have to know how I look at all times. I can't risk having a bad photo where I end up looking fat or manly or whatever because I have to look perfectly girly and pretty at all times. Some people accuse my voice of being fake because it's really high, but I'm not faking my voice.",Am I ESFP?,my main concern in life is being girly and chic i hate anything perceived a masculine such a playing sport watching competitive thing playing video game wearing dark color listening to rap music and other thing i like watching fashion vlogs makeup tutorial singing dancing shopping taking selfies and other thing along those line my career goal is to become a visual merchandiser for a high end designer brand like chanel in school i m pretty lazy and don t care about my grade a long a i pas i just want to do the bare minimum i find cheating on exam fun usually copy other people s work have gotten truancy letter and have failed a couple class group member have had a problem with me for free riding but i always just dismiss them with a sassy reply i m uninterested in getting to know my classmate because a shallow a it sound i don t care to befriend anyone unless i find them girly and pretty because i want friend i share common interest with i come across bitchy and cold partially because i barely speak or smile i don t care about the hater at all and i m known to have an attitude i ve sassed many customer at work and i m quite blunt so it s not rare for people to have an issue with me in the first place i barely work anyway because i just want free time to do thing i enjoy my biggest fear is becoming fat and manly because those are thing i really can t stand on other people i have to be a girly and skinny a possible i m not interested in dating but if i were to date i d want a guy to spoil me with gift treat me like i m a queen and do thing my way i have expensive taste and like the finer thing in life i think expensive designer item like chanel ysl celine prada louis vuitton and more are so gorgeous and i aspire to collect many of these item to make people jealous also even though i don t drink i think going to expensive fancy restaurant with champagne and expensive red wine is classy and chic one of my friend s mom ha many designer item love fine dining and life an extravagant life i wish she wa my mom instead i love the kylie jenner lifestyle minus her body because she s plastic i hate surgery my ideal place to travel is anywhere people view a classy chic and girly like paris my idol is ariana grande because she s so girly and successful yet she s still a feminist who know her worth and will put people in their place for disrespecting her even though i barely speak i also really like attention and praise if i m more extroverted i sometimes will talk a lot but if the conversation isn t in my interest i don t want to speak at all i hate having my picture taken because i have to know how i look at all time i can t risk having a bad photo where i end up looking fat or manly or whatever because i have to look perfectly girly and pretty at all time some people accuse my voice of being fake because it s really high but i m not faking my voice am i,2890,579,0.073,0.226,0.701,0.9987

Then one day a couple weeks later, he just made a complete 180 overnight.Within 12 hours his texts suddenly became short, indifferent, and dismissive, and he was the same in person too. I honestly don‚Äôt know what happened, and we never got around to talking about it due to circumstance and him avoiding me. We were still pretty new to each other so I kinda just let this happen and figured we weren‚Äôt right for each other, but then by chance we met somewhere at an event and he ended up kissing me out of the blue (there was some alcoholic influence).After this though, we talked, and he said he didn‚Äôt know what he wants but that he still wants to be friends. At this point I still wasn‚Äôt that emotionally invested so I said that was fine. I had already figured we wouldn‚Äôt work out so I was t really let down.Over the next few weeks though, he paid a lot of attention to me and showered me with a lot of care and I‚Äôll admit that what was just a little crush before turned into me actually liking him. I put it aside because I knew he didn‚Äôt feel the same though.At some point he again suddenly stopped talking to me and growing distant again. I felt that for myself the healthiest thing to do this time was to let it happen and not question it, because I didn‚Äôt want to be at the mercy of my feelings for him anymore, and he‚Äôs clearly truly unsure of what he wants.This was going fine, but he again did a complete 180 one day and had come back to showing me a lot of attention and concern.

953,1,"I am an INFJ and I was dating an ESFP for three months. Ninety percent of our relationship was fun, positive and enjoyable although we had some differences in our communication styles -- for example when we'd text, I could text him a huge paragraph conveying all my feelings, details about my day, etc., and he might respond with ""cool!"" A couple weeks ago, we had an argument over text about this communication difference (it took him several hours to respond to something important and it was really brief). After a brief heated exchange he immediately said via text ""maybe we are just better off as friends."" I was shocked that he would throw in the towel so quickly after one sign of conflict, when literally the day before we'd been cuddling on his couch talking about how much we liked each other. The next day I asked to meet up in person and after five minutes of talking we ""got back together."" I was again shocked at how quickly he could go from ""let's be friends"" to ""let's date again."" For me, I would never end something until I've given it a lot of careful thought. Fast forward two weeks and we were doing great, at least from my perspective. Hanging out every day he asked me to be his valentine, meet his family, book a trip together. He'd say things like ""I really really like you."" He purchased a bed for my dog at his house. He purchased puzzles on Amazon for us to work on while we watched TV together. Then, he had a  meeting with his therapist and they talked about our relationship in depth. Apparently the therapist told him that our communication differences would never work. My boyfriend called me after the meeting and told me that he had to cancel our plans that evening (about 20 minutes before I was supposed to meet him, no explanation except he'd ""had a day""). I tried to reach out that night to find out if he was OK and he responded hours later with just ""I'm OK thanks."" The next day, I hear nothing. I finally reach out and ask if everything is OK between us and he finally tells me that he's questioning the relationship. We go back and forth, and he seems to be really undecided about it still saying several times ""I'm a mess and all over the place."" When I try to talk some more he says ""please please stop I can't talk about this right now."" I give him space and assume we can talk more when he's feeling better. Instead, he texts the next day and says ""I think we should break up for right now."" Here are my questions: Literally the day before all this happened, he did a lot of things like asking me to be his valentine, talking about going on trips together, etc. that indicated to me he was investing in me. Then, he does a 180 literally in one day. Is this an ESFP thing? Going back and forth? Also, he seems to really avoid the difficult conversations. He'd rather say ""My brain is all over the place"" or end things than to have a difficult conversation about an issue we're having. It's like he'd rather run away from the problem than face it head on. Is this also an ESFP thing?

Apart from those I'd just meet him in his car and he'd do a lot of touch/kiss with me which I absolutely enjoyed them cause I loved him.

You should look for a sugar daddy instead""As an ISFJ I just want to be appreciated and my top love language according to the 5 love languages theory is gift giving (being spoiled in general)I don't date to use people and actually on behalf of ISFJs I can say that a little effort will satisfy us a lot.

974,1,"I wrote up a list of what I believe makes me an ESFP. Let me know if you relate to or disagree with any of the below!1. Non JudgementalESFPs prefer to see the good in everyone. They are open minded and quite comfortable with accepting other‚Äôs differences, even if they don‚Äôt personally agree with them, as long as they don‚Äôt severely clash with the ESFP‚Äôs personal values. The worst thing to an ESFP is when someone tries to impose their values onto them. 2. Social ChameleonESFPs have a talent for being able to get along with different types of people by reading a room and matching its energy. Whether it‚Äôs a party or a book club, ESFPs can change their energy/demeanor to one that fits appropriately to the setting.3. Small Inner CircleEven though they may have a large number of friends and acquaintances, ESFPs tend to only have a few select people they can trust and feel comfortable enough to share their most private inner thoughts and feelings. 4. Alone Time to RechargeESFPs love people and social settings, but need time alone to process their feelings and the events of the day. ESFPs need quiet time to self-reflect on their values and review/refine them to make sure they align correctly with who they are.5. Gut FeelingAn ESFP has no problem trusting their gut when making a decision, because their gut feeling is heavily tied with their moral code and values. If their gut says yes, to an ESFP, there is no doubt.6. FOMO: Fear of Missing OutThe thought of missing out on something fun is almost painful for an ESFP. With every occasion comes the possibility of something awesome happening, and they don‚Äôt want to risk not being there for it.7. Seeing Both SidesESFPs can have trouble making a decision or choosing a side when they are able to see the validity in both arguments. This can turn into an unhealthy form of analysis paralysis, and frustrate others as they perceive the ESFP as wishy washy.8. Likes People, but Not EveryoneOthers may see the ESFP as a people pleaser who likes everyone, but this is only partly true. Yes, the ESFP naturally enjoy making others happy and are accepting of others‚Äô differences, but they will not waste a single breath on those who offend or breach their personal values.9. Sensitive to RejectionESFPs are sensitive to criticism from others, especially from those who they have no problem with, and will take it personally. They‚Äôll often become stuck in their heads mulling over what they might have done wrong  for others to not like them, and find it hard to accept that not everyone will like you no matter how hard you try.10. Communicates LiterallyESFPs will say exactly what they mean and not beat around the bush. They can be frustrated when others take a long time to get to the point, are passive aggressive, or use cryptic wording that requires reading between the lines. 11. Attuned to Other‚Äôs EmotionsESFPs have a natural knack for noticing sudden changes in facial expressions and are sensitive to others‚Äô feelings. This skill is useful for when the ESFP is engaging others and reading the room. This may however become an issue when the ESFP‚Äôs intuition is actually incorrect, which can lead to misunderstanding and misreading the situation.12. Great in CrisisESFPs are surprisingly good at staying calm and efficient under crisis. It‚Äôs as if they enter a hyper focus mode where nothing else matters except finding the most efficient solution possible.13. Trouble Putting Emotions into WordsAlthough the ESFP can experience strong emotions and often make feelings-based decisions, they can have trouble putting these emotions into words. They can often recognize what they‚Äôre feeling but may need time to process why they‚Äôre feeling that way.14. Picture Perfect Memory (Selective)ESFPs can be scatterbrained and forgetful at times, but have the ability to recall and visualize important memories with incredibly detailed accuracy. They will remember the sights, sounds, and smells that took place in that moment. It‚Äôs hard for an ESFP to remember names, but they will never forget a face.15. Hates InauthenticityESFPs are commonly judged as fake because of their natural openness towards others and positivity. People may be turned off by someone who seems happy all the time, not realizing that ESFPs also experience negative feelings, they are just more private about them. In reality, ESFPs hate inauthenticity and are incapable of pretending to like someone they cannot stand, even if they were paid to do so. Acting in a way that is not their natural selves will trigger the gag reflex in an ESFP.",15 Things ESFPs Do,i wrote up a list of what i believe make me an let me know if you relate to or disagree with any of the below 1 non al prefer to see the good in everyone they are open minded and quite comfortable with accepting other‚Äôs difference even if they don‚Äôt personally agree with them a long a they don‚Äôt severely clash with the ‚Äôs personal value the worst thing to an is when someone try to impose their value onto them 2 social chameleon have a talent for being able to get along with different type of people by reading a room and matching it energy whether it‚Äôs a party or a book club s can change their energy demeanor to one that fit appropriately to the setting 3 small inner circleeven though they may have a large number of friend and acquaintance s tend to only have a few select people they can trust and feel comfortable enough to share their most private inner thought and s 4 alone time to recharges love people and social setting but need time alone to process their s and the event of the day s need quiet time to self reflect on their value and review refine them to make sure they align correctly with who they are 5 gut an ha no problem trusting their gut when making a decision because their gut is heavily tied with their moral code and value if their gut say yes to an there is no doubt 6 fomo fear of missing outthe thought of missing out on something fun is almost painful for an with every occasion come the possibility of something awesome happening and they don‚Äôt want to risk not being there for it 7 seeing both side can have trouble making a decision or choosing a side when they are able to see the validity in both argument this can turn into an unhealthy form of analysis paralysis and frustrate others a they perceive the a wishy washy 8 like people but not everyoneothers may see the a a people pleaser who like everyone but this is only partly true yes the naturally enjoy making others happy and are accepting of others‚Äô difference but they will not waste a single breath on those who offend or breach their personal value 9 sensitive to rejection are sensitive to criticism from others especially from those who they have no problem with and will take it personally they‚Äôll often become stuck in their head mulling over what they might have done wrong for others to not like them and find it hard to accept that not everyone will like you no matter how hard you try 10 communicates literallys will say exactly what they mean and not beat around the bush they can be frustrated when others take a long time to get to the point are passive aggressive or use cryptic wording that requires reading between the line 11 attuned to other‚Äôs emotion have a natural knack for noticing sudden change in facial expression and are sensitive to others‚Äô s this skill is useful for when the is engaging others and reading the room this may however become an issue when the ‚Äôs intuition is actually incorrect which can lead to misunderstanding and misreading the situation 12 great in crisis are surprisingly good at staying calm and efficient under crisis it‚Äôs a if they enter a hyper focus mode where nothing else matter except finding the most efficient solution possible 13 trouble putting emotion into wordsalthough the can experience strong emotion and often make s based decision they can have trouble putting these emotion into word they can often recognize what they‚Äôre but may need time to process why they‚Äôre that way 14 picture perfect memory selective s can be scatterbrained and forgetful at time but have the ability to recall and visualize important memory with incredibly detailed accuracy they will remember the sight sound and smell that took place in that moment it‚Äôs hard for an to remember name but they will never forget a face 15 hate inauthenticitys are commonly judged a fake because of their natural openness towards others and positivity people may be turned off by someone who seems happy all the time not realizing that s also experience negative s they are just more private about them in reality s hate inauthenticity and are incapable of pretending to like someone they cannot stand even if they were paid to do so acting in a way that is not their natural self will trigger the gag reflex in an 15 thing s do,4255,774,0.137,0.182,0.681,0.9898

I'm trying really hard to help her, but honestly, many people are having a problem communicating with her and are getting frustrated with her lack of organization and always looking to others for (group think) instead of having a vision and not feeling like a leader. I think she's also losing respect for seeming to be more about leading through her social game. I'm not out to get her, but she is obviously using my name to blame for things she isn't doing. The way you can tell this isn't true is that she doesn't come back and bring me in her office to tell me how I underperformed. I hear through other people what she is saying. The fact that she doesn't tell me, shows that she knows it isn't true. I'm just a scapegoat. That said, I'm not trying to go to war with her. I'm not trying to sabotage her.

995,1,"Hi, INFJ here :) I‚Äôm dating an ESFP guy and while I really like many things about him (e.g. he‚Äôs confident, smart, fun, understanding, open-minded, etcetc), there are also some things about him that worry me.1) He doesn‚Äôt seem to think much about the practical aspects of his future, like work, and treats it quite carelessly, and he doesn‚Äôt seem to like commitment very much. It comes off as him being lazy/unmotivated to take charge of his life. 2) In person, he‚Äôs quite present and interactive, but when it comes to texting, his responses tend to be short and missing depth. I also want to feel involved in his life, and this makes it harder. He says he prefers to talk in person, which is fine, but it‚Äôs an LDR so we don‚Äôt get to meet very often, and we can only call sometimes when our timings match, so text is the only way to really stay connected. Although he‚Äôs been trying a little more since I talked to him about this which I appreciate. I know he‚Äôs trying to get his life in order, because he had some difficulties previously, and I really want to be patient and supportive, but as an INFJ I really can‚Äôt help but overthink and feel upset when he seems aloof, and worry about his future because I know he‚Äôs so capable and smart but he just doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything about it. I guess I‚Äôm just trying to understand how ESFP think better, their needs, and how I can be a better girlfriend to him without stressing too much?

1003,1,"I'm a female INFJ and I've been dating a male ESFP for about 2 months. There are a lot of things I really like about him. He's easygoing, warm-hearted, fun, sensitive, confident and a lover of life. There are just a couple things I am having trouble working through and I really want to make it work. Hoping for advice from some other ESFPs who might understand firsthand.1. Talking about ""abstract ideas"" and such. I love talking about the meaning of something, why people do things the way that they do, basically anything involving the ""why"" of things. Sometimes it feels like talking to a brick wall. For example, we were watching a television show last night I said ""wow there are a lot of underlying political statements being made in this show"" hoping to start a conversation about the topic and get into a little bit of depth. Instead, his response was ""Hmmm"" and then he proceeded to make a goofy comment about the outfit that a character was wearing. Other times, he won't really respond until like five minutes later. So that makes me think maybe it takes him awhile to process? I just don't know how the ESFP brain works. My question here -- is there any way to coax more depth from him in these kinds of moments? As an INFJ I need a bit of this to feel like my soul is being satisfied. I love the goofy comments and such too, but I need the serious discussions as well. 2. The value he places in social approval. For example, his friends were over yesterday and the discussion got a bit misogynistic at least in my book. He does not think that way himself (I know this for certain) but rather than lead the group to a different discussion topic, he let it happen without saying anything. It's hard for me to understand this. If my friends were making racist comments or something for example, I would at least say *something* to shut the conversation down. In other situations -- when we have big groups of people, he tends to leave me to ""fend for myself"" and seems more concerned with fitting in with the group himself. It just seems that being in the ""in crowd"" is really important to him and he is not one to stand up for his values the way that I am. I would be interested to hear an ESFP's perspective on this. Why is ""following the crowd"" so important? It is just hard for me to understand as an INFJ where I will literally isolate myself from society if I don't agree with it and I give zero fucks what ""cool"" people think.",INJF - ESFP relationship -- can it work?,i m a female infj and i ve been dating a male for about 2 month there are a lot of thing i really like about him he s easygoing warm hearted fun sensitive confident and a lover of life there are just a couple thing i am having trouble working through and i really want to make it work hoping for advice from some other s who might understand firsthand 1 talking about abstract idea and such i love talking about the meaning of something why people do thing the way that they do basically anything involving the why of thing sometimes it feel like talking to a brick wall for example we were watching a television show last night i said wow there are a lot of underlying political statement being made in this show hoping to start a conversation about the topic and get into a little bit of depth instead his response wa hmmm and then he proceeded to make a goofy comment about the outfit that a character wa wearing other time he won t really respond until like five minute later so that make me think maybe it take him awhile to process i just don t know how the brain work my question here is there any way to coax more depth from him in these kind of moment a an infj i need a bit of this to feel like my soul is being satisfied i love the goofy comment and such too but i need the serious discussion a well 2 the value he place in social approval for example his friend were over yesterday and the discussion got a bit misogynistic at least in my book he doe not think that way himself i know this for certain but rather than lead the group to a different discussion topic he let it happen without saying anything it s hard for me to understand this if my friend were making racist comment or something for example i would at least say something to shut the conversation down in other situation when we have big group of people he tends to leave me to fend for myself and seems more concerned with fitting in with the group himself it just seems that being in the in crowd is really important to him and he is not one to stand up for his value the way that i am i would be interested to hear an s perspective on this why is following the crowd so important it is just hard for me to understand a an infj where i will literally isolate myself from society if i don t agree with it and i give zero fuck what cool people think injf relationship can it work,2357,464,0.039,0.135,0.826,0.9909

1015,1,"I‚Äôve had a crush on an ESFP who went to my undergrad for the past 8 years since I graduated. Back when we were students, he was a year below and pursued me first, but then I immediately graduated and that was the end of it. He‚Äôs so sweet and energetic I thought he was gay at first. Silly me. He‚Äôs just a thoughtful, sensitive guy with the widest smile and tons of positive energy.  Very popular and ambitious and always on the go. We recently ended up in the same town for work stuff and saw each other for the first time since college and there were freakin‚Äô fireworks. He asked me to meet up and get dinner together, so he found a place  to eat after the one I suggested ended up being close. We were vibing and he invited me to his place, and we ended up chilling/making out/sleeping together. Def not something I do regularly, but I was feeling it since he‚Äôs such a gentleman and asked me deep, thoughtful questions and tried to make sure I was comfortable and complimented me with the sweetest words I‚Äôd ever heard a man say.  It was like out of a movie and I was putty in his hands, but he was putty in mine too so it worked out nicely. He paid for me to Uber home (had to peace onto quickly to catch a flight home and he seemed sad) and has been messaging me ever since. I‚Äôm not moving to his city for six months or so, but he seems to want to stay in touch. He travels for leisure and his job all but a few days out of the  month, so not sure what potential is there for a relationship. Since ESFPs are here and now kind of people‚Äîlike us ENFPs‚ÄîI‚Äôm wondering what you guys think of him in terms of how he‚Äôs acting based on how you‚Äôve acted with those you‚Äôve made a connection with. I don‚Äôt know what I want yet, but he‚Äôs pretty cool and it‚Äôd be good to see him again. You ESFPs have that combo of idealism and being action-oriented which is super attractive to those of us who overthink everything. Feeling optimistic but not obsessive. It‚Äôs a peaceful feeling that comes from how proactive he‚Äôs been, and being considerably older and wiser than when we first met. I feel like we‚Äôre evenly matched in terms of social skills and how busy we both are which is refreshing because it doesn‚Äôt feel that way with NTs.

I‚Äôm actually quite laid back once you‚Äôd get to know me, and (I‚Äôd like to think) funny/playful. It just takes a lot of one on one interactions for me to feel safe opening up. Basically, I have no idea how to become close with an ESFP. They always seem to bounce around a lot, make friends with a lot of people, but then it feels like I‚Äôm forgotten. I suppose a part of the issue is because I‚Äôm definitely not assertive, and I feel like in order for ESFPs to notice you, you have to be assertive. And I‚Äôm just.. not.

1042,1," (TL;DR: Question for the ESFPs. How do you deal with possible situations which would be bad at a specific time like an unwanted pregnancy?)That was the short version, now in-depth:I'm (32, ENFP-A, type 2 closely followed by 7) in a polyamorous relationship with my husband (36, INFP-T, type 4) and my boyfriend (25, ESFP-A, type 7). They are not romantically involved with each other, but are good friends. My husband and I live together. And there are shared visions of all of us living together.Hubby and I are somewhat ready for a child but we're not actively trying, since we have a lot going on in our lives, well especially he. We've been together for 14 years now and have a very happy relationship. He and I are very typically xNxP types as we're often in our heads, think through patterns, future-oriented emotional thinkers.BF and I have been together for only about 6 months now. We're extremely happy and we're both in for the long run. I can't believe the luck I've had to find two soulmates like this... but anyways, BF is very typically ESFP. Very much lives in the moment, happy-go-lucky, if something isn't a problem right now - don't waste worry on it kinda guy. I love this about him, even 'though it can lead to neglecting plans that might be important for his life and organising his time is quite a task for him. He is 7 years younger than I and is in the middle of his studies at university and doesn't yet know what he'll do later and if he ever even wants kids of his own.Now, I'm not really asking for advice, since my situation isn't real yet, but it made me think how ESFPs generally react to stuff like that. I'm about to get my period, I hope, but for some reason a part of me is afraid of being pregnant. There was some light nausea and unusual cramping which confused me, but I'm probably not pregnant. It would be my boyfriends for sure. (We did use a condom, but you know..)If the universe would only revolve around me I'd be okay with it. I told him quite early in the relationship that if an accident should ever happen and I was to  get pregnant, I wouldn't have an abortion, I'm just not at the age and life stage anymore where I'd want to. He knows that. And we talked about it a couple times. Husband also knows that and is okay with it.But the universe does not revolve around me and I think  pregnancy right now would be a really really really shitty thing for both my men at the moment. So, that's why I really hope I'm not pregnant - it can wait, I'm in no hurry.But it's interesting to think about it: My husband would flip, I mean he'd be so overwhelmed and directly dive into a spiral of ""ohmygods"", because it would mean a lot of changes in our lives and it wasn't part of his future plans...And with my bf: Even 'though I think it would be the worst for him (young, still studying, doesn't know if he wants kids ever) I think he'd be the one handling it the best, because of his one day after another approach on life.That's where I come back to my question: Do ESFPs generally handle situations like this well or are they either go with the flow or flee the scene types?I'm interested in your answers, thx for reading that whole wall for those who have ;)",How do ESFPs handle stressful news like an unwanted pregnancy?,tl dr question for the s how do you deal with possible situation which would be bad at a specific time like an unwanted pregnancy that wa the short version now in depth i m 32 enfp a type 2 closely followed by 7 in a polyamorous relationship with my husband 36 infp t type 4 and my boyfriend 25 a type 7 they are not romantically involved with each other but are good friend my husband and i live together and there are shared vision of all of u living together hubby and i are somewhat ready for a child but we re not actively trying since we have a lot going on in our life well especially he we ve been together for 14 year now and have a very happy relationship he and i are very typically xnxp type a we re often in our head think through pattern future oriented emotional thinker bf and i have been together for only about 6 month now we re extremely happy and we re both in for the long run i can t believe the luck i ve had to find two soulmates like this but anyways bf is very typically very much life in the moment happy go lucky if something isn t a problem right now don t waste worry on it kinda guy i love this about him even though it can lead to neglecting plan that might be important for his life and organising his time is quite a task for him he is 7 year younger than i and is in the middle of his study at university and doesn t yet know what he ll do later and if he ever even want kid of his own now i m not really asking for advice since my situation isn t real yet but it made me think how s generally react to stuff like that i m about to get my period i hope but for some reason a part of me is afraid of being pregnant there wa some light nausea and unusual cramping which confused me but i m probably not pregnant it would be my boyfriend for sure we did use a condom but you know if the universe would only revolve around me i d be okay with it i told him quite early in the relationship that if an accident should ever happen and i wa to get pregnant i wouldn t have an abortion i m just not at the age and life stage anymore where i d want to he know that and we talked about it a couple time husband also know that and is okay with it but the universe doe not revolve around me and i think pregnancy right now would be a really really really shitty thing for both my men at the moment so that s why i really hope i m not pregnant it can wait i m in no hurry but it s interesting to think about it my husband would flip i mean he d be so overwhelmed and directly dive into a spiral of ohmygods because it would mean a lot of change in our life and it wasn t part of his future plan and with my bf even though i think it would be the worst for him young still studying doesn t know if he want kid ever i think he d be the one handling it the best because of his one day after another approach on life that s where i come back to my question do s generally handle situation like this well or are they either go with the flow or flee the scene type i m interested in your answer thx for reading that whole wall for those who have how do s handle stressful news like an unwanted pregnancy,3118,651,0.067,0.142,0.791,0.9952

1055,1,"Dear esfps, I'm an enfp female, and I have a crush on an esfp male. He has a crush on me as well, and I know this cus he's told me. Of course, I'm still nervous about getting into another relationship (had a bad breakup before we met). We've liked each other for quite awhile. He's usually busy with college and work, so we hardly ever get to hangout, but whenever we do it's really amazing and fun.It's so easy for me to read him when we're in person, but in text it's extremely difficult. I hardly ever have a problem deciphering how a person is through text, but with him it's like I'm always second guessing everything. Another thing is that we hardly ever text each other, and whenever we do, I'm always the one to text first. Is that normal for an esfp?I deal with anxiety and depression, and I know that esfps find it difficult to deal with people like that cus it drains them, so I try to ignore it as best as I can, but I can't help but feel like my emotions and feelings are being caged up with no way to express then or tell them to him - someone I trust. Is there a way I can tell him things without affecting him negatively?

Before we got together, we shared alot about our past relationships and i know the scars he has had from previous relationships. During the relationship, we both had our guard up because of our history in other relationships. When he sat me down for that conversation, I think i had my guard up and started analysing how because of what happened, maybe he couldnt open his heart up or he is afraid of repeating mistakes. I have been very nice to him and he couldnt stress that enough. We decided to take a break and he cried when i left and said sorry. i have been a big part of his life. i was calm through the conversation. Over the week, my mind went crazy and i started analysing myself and texting him alot. I think i was also having PMS. he said i kept going back and forth with what i want and that he feels i turn myself into what i think he wants and its not what he asked for. He asked me to think about who i am and what i want. i think due to my crazinesss, he made a decsion to end things. I have asked for a conversation but he asked me to do it over a phonecall. my last text to him was to apologise for how intense the last week was and its cool we chill for awhile. My friends have found him back on Tinder.At this point, i feel that he has made me aware of what went on and that I needed to fix myself. I still feel i would like to have a conversation with him to apologise for the further damage i have done to him by using his history against him. I would like to do so after I have fixed myself and not feel like i want him back anymore. I guesss my question is, how long should i take for him to be less angry about everything that has been said.

1102,1," I know what my ""possible"" type might be but I would rather you type me not knowing anything due to bias.¬†I'm 21 years old and a female. I have always felt very different from others, misunderstood, underappreciated and in some cases walked over. (used to happen a lot as a child)I'm empathetic, I care a lot about the underprivileged and about world issues although I know there isnt much I can do due to the established systems. I usually manage to chose who to empathize with, I think more in terms of sympathy rather than empathy. I always give money to the homeless.¬†I can express my feelings in text, not in person. When I write I dont write very literally when it comes to my feelings, but rather metaphorically. Sometimes I just dont understand my feelings or why I feel the way I do, am I overreacting to things? I cant make sense of my feelings, which is why I usually seek outside perspective, asking people about if my reactions are sensitive- usually it is in terms of anger and frustration when I talk about feelings.¬†I am very talkative when I want to talk about something I really enjoy, science, philosophy, politics, anything that you think about- that makes you theorize. I love theories and I love philosophy. Although I am talkative, I can be extremely quit and shy. I seek humans sometimes for connection when I feel too lonely, the only person¬† I have is my boyfriend. I love meeting new people but I can get bored very very easily if the person is extremely predictable- I dont like predictable people but at the same time if I cant predict them I get too stressed. I need to know their motives and how they function and how they react in certain situations, which is why I sometimes ""test"" people.¬†I enjoy debating, seeing things from other perspectives and understanding WHY people think the way they do and what makes them think the way they do, which is why I have a fascination with national socialism, why would anyone adapt such an illogical ideology when it doesnt make any sense, from a scientific viewpoint? If it did then I would understand. I have a hard time accepting peoples views if they dont make sense, unfortunately, and I tend to get angry and emotional when someone elses argument doesnt make any logical sense- and if it is only based on their opinion and understanding of the world- I need theories that are based on facts, on some reliable foundation.¬†I love reading, I have a vivid imagination and I talk to myself way too much. I enjoy theatre I would think and I like poetry. I just like to write down my thoughts and ideas, feelings and such since I just cant express them in normal form.¬†I am very very kind, sometimes too kind, especially to strangers. I treat everyone the same- thats not even a rule I have, it just happens naturally.¬†I can be selfish at times, quite a lot actually. Just more of a ""me"" attitude at times, probably because of my parents spoiling me. I grew up in a fairly religion family but as long as I can remember I've always, compared to my siblings, been the one questioning God. I am in my first relationship right now, and it is not going very well. My partner is insensitive, whenever there is an issue I want to resolve it immediately, since I'm very direct. I don't want to move on or talk about it later, I want to talk about it now, why should I leave a problem unsolved? I hate uncertainty more than anything, I need to know that we are good so I can be ready to settle down and plan for my future.¬†I feel like a walking alien, living a life I have not chosen to live but am thankful for, trying to find my purpose in life every day, my passion, what I want to do forever. But since my Interests are wide I can't. I've always been the weird kid in school, the oddball but never really bullied- strangely so. I just have never felt in place in this world, and it feels like no one thinks the way I do. Everyone says that I think in a different way. I'm lazy but with ambition, I have potential to do lots of things and I am very optimistic about everything. I always wonder about things. So, I apologise for the long text, what time would you say I am, according to what I have written?¬†(I failed to mention that I have been diagnosed with anxiety and atypical autism- which is, having traits related to some autistic traits at age 13, just in case that might help in typing me)",Am I an ESFP?,i know what my possible type might be but i would rather you type me not knowing anything due to bias i m 21 year old and a female i have always felt very different from others misunderstood underappreciated and in some case walked over used to happen a lot a a child i m empathetic i care a lot about the underprivileged and about world issue although i know there isnt much i can do due to the established system i usually manage to chose who to empathize with i think more in term of sympathy rather than empathy i always give money to the homeless i can express my s in text not in person when i write i dont write very literally when it come to my s but rather metaphorically sometimes i just dont understand my s or why i feel the way i do am i overreacting to thing i cant make sense of my s which is why i usually seek outside perspective asking people about if my reaction are sensitive usually it is in term of anger and frustration when i talk about s i am very talkative when i want to talk about something i really enjoy science philosophy politics anything that you think about that make you theorize i love theory and i love philosophy although i am talkative i can be extremely quit and shy i seek human sometimes for connection when i feel too lonely the only person i have is my boyfriend i love meeting new people but i can get bored very very easily if the person is extremely predictable i dont like predictable people but at the same time if i cant predict them i get too stressed i need to know their motif and how they function and how they react in certain situation which is why i sometimes test people i enjoy debating seeing thing from other perspective and understanding why people think the way they do and what make them think the way they do which is why i have a fascination with national socialism why would anyone adapt such an illogical ideology when it doesnt make any sense from a scientific viewpoint if it did then i would understand i have a hard time accepting people view if they dont make sense unfortunately and i tend to get angry and emotional when someone el argument doesnt make any logical sense and if it is only based on their opinion and understanding of the world i need theory that are based on fact on some reliable foundation i love reading i have a vivid imagination and i talk to myself way too much i enjoy theatre i would think and i like poetry i just like to write down my thought and idea s and such since i just cant express them in normal form i am very very kind sometimes too kind especially to stranger i treat everyone the same thats not even a rule i have it just happens naturally i can be selfish at time quite a lot actually just more of a me attitude at time probably because of my parent spoiling me i grew up in a fairly religion family but a long a i can remember i ve always compared to my sibling been the one questioning god i am in my first relationship right now and it is not going very well my partner is insensitive whenever there is an issue i want to resolve it immediately since i m very direct i don t want to move on or talk about it later i want to talk about it now why should i leave a problem unsolved i hate uncertainty more than anything i need to know that we are good so i can be ready to settle down and plan for my future i feel like a walking alien living a life i have not chosen to live but am thankful for trying to find my purpose in life every day my passion what i want to do forever but since my interest are wide i can t i ve always been the weird kid in school the oddball but never really bullied strangely so i just have never felt in place in this world and it feel like no one think the way i do everyone say that i think in a different way i m lazy but with ambition i have potential to do lot of thing and i am very optimistic about everything i always wonder about thing so i apologise for the long text what time would you say i am according to what i have written i failed to mention that i have been diagnosed with anxiety and atypical autism which is having trait related to some autistic trait at age 13 just in case that might help in typing me am i an,4176,825,0.078,0.147,0.775,0.9974

1122,1,"Growing up;Mom - ENFJ - super sweet, so so naive!!  We fought a TON during my teen years. She never understood my freedom needs and my impulsivity. She tries to ‚Äúfix‚Äù everything but we are very close now. Dad - ISTP - Fierce temper, but we got along amazing!!  I felt like I was his clone and until we did personality tests, I was sure we could‚Äôve been the same type. His typing couldn‚Äôt have been more accurate though. He also saved lives for a living, so made sense. He taught me how to be super handy and helps me with projects all of the time. Older sibling - ISFP - Never have fought more with anyone like I did and still do with this sibling. We can‚Äôt seem to really trust or fully enjoy each otherOlder sibling - INTJ - Super easy to get along with and I would say we were and are as close as you can be with an INTJYounger sibling - ISFP. As kids, we were very close and even closer as adults. We do struggle a lot with communication as he thinks I sap his energy. He says he can‚Äôt converse as quickly as I do and so with this info, it‚Äôs helped my communication with the older ISFP. Now with my own familyMe- ESFP - obviously the coolest typeHusband- ENTP - I find him fascinating and also incredibly boring. üòÇWe do things very differently but we have had a pretty awesome marriage. Child- INFPChild- INFJGrowing up we pretty well understood each other. I of course was so frustrated with being the ESFP because NO ONE TALKED in my family. Haha. So I was definitely the annoying one but we had some crazy shenanigans in this home with all of the sensors and the INTJ was probably the second most ballsy next to my ISTP dad. It was a wild and fun household. With the family I created, man alive I struggle sometimes as the only sensor!!  Everyone in my house is pretty cautious and stuck in their heads all of the time. The kids especially, yikes, so so sensitive!  üòÇ. It makes it very challenging for me to understand them and to curb my insensitivity sometimes. Also, any other ESFP‚Äôs stay at home parents??  I‚Äôve been one for 14 years now and it feels like a prison sometimes. If I could choose again, I wouldn‚Äôt be a SAHP but this is the life I chose and so I choose to enjoy it to the best of my abilities.

1148,1,"Hiya, I'm a ISFP/ESFP mix. Could you help type me? (I'm mildly autistic so I may not seem very feeler like)I'm not all that introverted. I've always enjoyed socialising but I lose energy quickly and randomly which is pretty annoying. It doesnt follow a pattern either, so I could be out and I would suddenly fall very tired. Other times I can keep going for ages and really enjoy myself! I have pretty bad social anxiety which stops me from making friends, seeing friends, going out quite a lot. But without that, I know I would like making friends and just having a great time with them.I'm definitely a feeler, but I lack empathy and quite a lot of emotion sometimes due to some weird emotional detachment I have which I've never been able to understand. I place more value on my heart than my head, and I've always loved making relationships. However, I'm not particularly loving, and I get angry when someone becomes too emotional or overreacts, like my dad does ü§¨ I also hate conflict, and I do remember lots of times when my parents or my friends would argue and I would just have to run away with a face full of tears üò∂ I still do that. I enjoy expressing myself and standing out, i cant be a nobody!! I struggle to be creative even though i enjoy it because i have issues with imagination.

1160,1,"So ever since i joined the MBTI community. I have always thought i was an ENFP. At the very least it was never a doubt in my mind that i was Intuitive (got typed as INFP) before.

I wanna understand how ESFPs are like from an ESFP perspective so that i can understand what my true type is. Information about me.- i am very scatterbrained. My teachers have always said i have a wide range of information but my issue is i simply dont have structure and cant settle down. - i have lots of different interests and ideas. I usually pick up an interest, think imma be a master at it then drop it coz i was lazy or something. - i am an optimist but i think im pretty realistic person. - my housemaid used to say ""Layton your problem is, you only know how to use your brain in class"". I have crap practical skills and basically freeload my way through life and school. ( im only 18)- i like football, anime, videogames but have a wide range of interests including philosophy, economics, politics, etc. - i love ideas that seem so spiritual and unseen. ( have interests in things like law of attraction, astrology, etc)- i do physical activity for fun and to look after my health. Used to be a couch potato but i grew more responsible for myself as i grew older and begun taking more care about myself. - i have had my friends take this test, 3 of them got INTJ, one got ENTJ, others are ENTP, ISFP, ISFJ. - i crush very easily. Learnt to control it better- when i play music, it triggers my imagination and i can run around my room for 2 hours in my imaginary world looking like a retard. - im lazy asf. - i hate partying coz i think its a waste of time. - keeping a routine is so fkin difficult omegalul. - have short ass attention span.

1162,1,"[MBTI was inconclusive between a few types](https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/co7jp8/please_type_me_im_so_confused/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) so I'm trying to find input to see which one fits better :-)**1) What do you yearn for in life? Why?**I really just want to have the freedom to live the way I want. If I want to sit on the computer and look at memes until 3am then I'm free to do so, if I want to eat out and eat junk food then I'm free to do so, etc. Large commitment like marriage and having kids and stuff like that makes me extremely uncomfortable and even a bit pissed thinking about it because you can't do anything or hang out with your friends because you're constantly cleaning and fighting and changing diapers etc. I want to be able to get involved in activites and community revolving around my interests and I'll end up skating around anything and everything that prevents me from doing that**2) Think about a time where you felt like you were at your finest. Tell us what made you feel that way.**I felt on top of the world when everything seems to be going right, all my favorite online communities are alive, my grades are fine, I'm on my parents' good side and we go out a lot, nobody is 'on my case' and trying to monitor everything I do, my friends invite me out, and I have events to look forward in the coming days. I feel happy when it's like that because I can enjoy myself and not have to worry about anything and have something to look forward to as well. It's a really happy feeling.**3) What makes you feel inferior?**When I try to speak up in a group of people and they all just stare at me stoicly and show this contempt that gives off this ""f you"" vibe. This happens especially with random adults that I try to talk to since I'm young. Or when I say something or do something and someone yells a varient of ""who do you think you are"" or ""who do you think you're talking to"" that makes me feel very small too. **4) What tends to weigh on your decisions? (Do you think about people, pro-cons, how you feel about it, etc.)**It depends.. if I'm choosing a short term thing like maybe an area to hang out at, I would probably base it off of ""hey the vending machine actually works there"" or ""yeah that other place has a lot of mesquitos"" or ""they have faster wifi"" etc. But if it's a long term thing like a college, I'd choose based on what they have available, what kind of people I would make friends with there, how close it is to the city, and am I going to be able to do the things I love there etc. **5) When working on a project what is normally your emphasis? Do you like to have control of the outcome?**If it's a school project 99% of the time I'm not even going to want to do it lol. So I'd probably procrastinate a lot and then when I finally start doing it I'll put a lot of emphasis on what's required of me and the specific instructions and what I need to do to not fail and get that done as fast as possible and then if I'm actually remotely interested in it I'll go back and add more quality. If it's a group project, I just sit my booty on my phone until someone tells me what I need to do to contribute and help out and I'll do that and then be done lol. **6) Describe us a time where you had a lot of fun. How is your memory of it?**I went to a large dinner with like 30+ people and I had some margaritas and took a lot of pictures, ordered a ton of desserts, told stories and laughed a lot and those 5-6 hours only felt like a few minutes to me because one funny/cool thing after another kept happening and it was like a non-stop stream of awesomeness and I never wanted to leave. I still remember it very well since it was an extremely significant event in my life. It changed my perspective a lot, it gave me a lot of faith in humanity and showed me that holy crap I didn't know people could be this nice and fun.**7) When you want to learn something new, what feels more natural for you? (Are you more prone to be hands on, to theorize, to memorize, etc)**It really depends what I'm learning. If im learning how to cook a meal I remember it better if I watch someone do it in front of me or do it myself. But if I'm learning something like the world maps, I tend to link the country names to something important to me (my friend was from X so now I'll never forget where it is on the map). If im learning how to use a new software then I'll start trying to find the basic features (how do I save? how do I set my profile picture? can I see my friends list?) and then familiarize myself like that. It reaaaaally depends though and I don't learn everything exclusively with one style**9) How organized do you to think of yourself as?**I only organize the things that matter to me I've noticed. Like, my locker can look like a landfill and my clothing drawer has no system to it whatsoever, but I also have folders and discord servers and photo albums that I've spend hours designing and making it organized so I can find everything in 1 second and it looks satisfying. But I can only find the energy to do that if its especially personally relevant. Everything else is a tornado**10) How do you judge new ideas? You try to understand the principles behind it to see if they make sense or do you look for information that supports it?**I think I tend to figure out how it works first?  like for MBTI I went straight to ok what do these letters stand for, what do they indicate, how do you decode the letters into a cognitive function stack, what do the cognitive functions stands for, how does this add up with me, etc. I really have no idea (I spent like 45 minutes on this question lol üòÇ)**11) You find harmony by making sure everyone is doing fine and belonging to a given group or by making sure that you follow what you believe and being yourself?**I think I definitely feel more at peace with the latter, I don't think I really pay attention to if everyone in the group is feeling fine and even if I did notice I wouldn't have the slightest idea what to do :/. On the other hand I feel very at ease when I'm allowed to express my excitement about an interest or a value and if I'm being critised or pushed down for it I consider that to be 0% harmony**12) Are you the kind that thinks before speaking or do you speak before thinking? Do you prefer one-on-one communication or group discussions?**I'm absolutely a speak-before-think person. To this day I still get dirty looks after blurting something out and regret it. It's a big issue since my childhood and I barely think things through and I've gotten screwed over many times. As for discussions I find groups to be a ton more fun, I feel like I'm not wasting my time when I speak (((assuming they're listening, and assuming the group didn't just break up and start a bunch of one-on-one micro convos))). And when my mind goes blank, I can rely on other people to prevent the awkward silence, and generally I feel more excited to speak up. Whereas one-on-one can be beneficial depending on the topic or if it's really personal or something, I just think it would be kind of stale if I had the choice between that or the group.**13) Do you jump into action right away or do you like to know where are you jumping before leaping? Does action speaks more than words?**This was a tough one for me and I actually had to ask a good friend who knew me very well about this lol. They said I'm definitely more of a leap first person and I don't do much thinking but this could very well just be my age. I'm p young. Also I think words can have a lot of meaning, I know that when I screw up I write apology essays and I know if someone writes one for me, I'll definitely acknowledge it and be touched by it. Actions are important too, I try to make sure I don't contradict my words but when I do and then the other person loses trust in me I dont blame them. They both have weight but just for different purposes. **14) It's Saturday. You're at home, and your favourite show is about to start. Your friends call you for a night out. What will you do?**This actually happened to me the other week lol!!! I was about to binge watch the office with a bowl of cheese balls when my friend called and wanted to go shopping. I was extremely hyped and jumped right out my chair to go meet them. There's no way I'm turning down an invitation to go out. Netflix is always there for me later**15) How do you act when you're stressed out?**When something bad is *actively* happening, for example my parents going through my web history or going through my room, during that kind of stress, my stomach physically feels sick and I really just start shutting down yet feel jerked awake at the same time. I can't do anything so I just stand there, actually physically shaking, feeling helpless because there's nothing I can do, and I start thinking bad things like ""Did I forget to clean my history?? They are going to find my X account, and then they're gonna dig around in my email and force the password out of me and go on a tangent and then find everything I've worked for and take it away from me and I'm not going to have a phone or Internet connection ever again and I have to buy a computer in secret somehow and run away and I'll be living life against my own family just to get my crap back"" and just go down that rabbit hole and start thinking what can I do to get out and if I can't get out I'll feel hopelessly trapped. All this turmoil and on the outside I'm simply unmoving, sweating, and have a straight face**16) What makes you dislike the personalities of some people?**I really really hate it when people are aloof and judgemental and indifferent especially when I'm being really excited about something or just simply trying to talk to them. I've met people who give off the impression of a snobby cult leader, and every word just seems to be going up their ass and it's a waste of time to talk to them. It's the kind of vibe that would make you feel like saying ""F*** YOU TOO"" even if they didn't say anything. Their body language and responses say it well enough. So stoic and stand offish.**17) Is there anything you really like talking about with other people?**I looooooooove talking about funny stories with people. Like I'll tell them about the time I sprayed some random crap and ruined the wall as a child and they'd tell me about another story about their experience or what they did as a child too. Just laughing at situations that weren't funny at the time haha. I also like talking about things that I'm interested in, like cats and what my cat does and what theirs does etc. If Im lucky I'll find someone who heard about MBTI but they're rare and they usually don't even remember their letters **18) What kind of things do you pay the least attention to in your life?**I don't pay attention to how I'm pervievd by others. This applies in a lot of ways. I don't care about my appearance, if I want to wear a T shirt and jeans they are comfortable for me and I don't care if I'm looking formal or impressing anyone. Of course I take care of my hygiene and don't want to smell bad but honestly I'm not a big fasionita either. I also shout blunt stuff sometimes like if someone hands me their business card I was like ""OH this is the company that screwed me over!!"" and then they're kind of offended. Also little things like dropping the entire spoon into the soup bowl and not noticing that the next person has to dig it out etc. I'm kind of a jack ass like that but I'm working on it**19) How do your friends perceive you? What is wrong about their perception? What would your friends never say about your personality?**A couple of my friends have said that I was very quiet at first, but then I started being talkative later. I think I was quiet mostly because my parents were closely watching and I was scared to get in trouble or say something that would get me screwed, or because I was face-in-phone and really absorbed in what I'm doing. Another group of friends see me as very vulgar because when there's absolutely no boundaries I start making really dirty jokes lol. One of my friends commented that I see the beauty in everything. Another friend sees me as polite and give more than I take. And my parents see me as outgoing, aware of my surroundings to an extent, and sometimes inappropriate and imposing and interrupt a lot. Somebody called me a lazy sloth too lol. It seems like the different people have different perceptions. But they all never seem to describe me as thoughtful or reserved or authoritian or anything like that.  Edit: I asked around some more and people said that I was idealistic (like for example I go to an extremely crappy restaurant and somehow still think it's awesome even when it was obviously dirty and customer service was poor lmao)**20) You got a whole day to do whatever you like. What kind of activities do you feel like doing?**I would probably go downtown and eat out and sit on a coffee shop's wifi to chat on reddit or something and browse memes, or spend time with my friends and buy a bunch of junk food that I can never finish and use my phone a lot. It depends lol",Am I an ESFP?,wa inconclusive between a few type,34,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

My mom had primary custody, so I lived with her and visited my dad every other weekend. Both of my parents remarried when I was relatively young. I have a complicated relationship with both my parents, they both have a lot of emotional problems that they never resolved or got treatment for. I‚Äôve been in weekly therapy for 4 years, so I‚Äôve been working through childhood trauma and I feel pretty at peace with everything. 4. I‚Äôm currently entering my last semester of my bachelors degree, and I‚Äôm getting a Bachelors of Arts degree in music. I‚Äôve been a singer and performer pretty much my entire life, and that‚Äôs what I intend to do as a career as well. I write my own music, and I‚Äôm currently working on my debut commercial album. I broke a 3 year writers block a few months ago, and I‚Äôve been creating a lot since then. Music, art, and performing are my ultimate passions in life, and I love dedicating time to them.5. If I had to spend an entire weekend by myself, I think I could go either way depending on the kind of week I had before. If I‚Äôve over-extended myself a lot prior to that weekend, then I‚Äôd probably be fine with hanging out by myself and just spending time in my own head. I tend to get under stimulated as well though, so if I wasn‚Äôt active enough the week prior, I would probably have a lot of pent up energy. If I could go out and exercise and be outside and burn off some steam though, I would be fine being by myself all weekend. I tend to get stuck in my head sometimes though, and if I‚Äôve been there too long, I have a hard time being by myself.6. I love reading, writing, traveling, skiing, riding bicycles, hiking, learning new things, watching movies and documentaries, working out (although I‚Äôve been out of the habit for a while), and watching music videos and interviews. I ran cross country at the beginning of high school, but I wasn‚Äôt very good at it. I‚Äôm not super into sports, I prefer to exercise and spend time outside in an unstructured setting. I tend to get cabin fever in the winter because I get a lot of pent up energy when I‚Äôm inside and inactive too long. I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to heat and humidity too, so when it‚Äôs really hot out for a few days, I get cabin fever from being inside and inactive as well.7. I consider myself a very curious person. I love learning about and researching new things, but I tend to overwhelm myself with information. A lot of the time, I learn about something just because I think it‚Äôs interesting, without any initial plan of doing anything with the info. I like to talk about interesting things I‚Äôve learned with my boyfriend, and I love sharing that info with him. I love books and I have a ton of them-I order a lot of them from amazon prime and I have a pretty big library. I love reading biographies about people who have made an impact on the world, mostly in the entertainment industry. I like to learn about their lives, and I try to figure out what made them successful, and what mistakes they made. Basically, I try to learn from their experiences. Most of the things I learn about are for my own self-growth. I love MBTI and the enneagram, and I used to spend a lot of time learning about psychology. I don‚Äôt really spend much time learning about technology, although I do like to predict how it may affect general life and the music industry. I‚Äôve pondered existential topics like spirituality, reincarnation, and philosophy, but if I go too far with that I end up with a lot of anxiety. I‚Äôm interested in how the universe works, but I‚Äôm not very good at math, so I usually focus on the theory end of science.8. I‚Äôm not sure if I would enjoy being in a leadership position. I think I‚Äôd enjoy motivating people and helping them reach their potential. If someone pisses me off or crosses a line with me, I don‚Äôt tend to be super tolerant of BS, but I‚Äôm generally a patient and understand person.9. I‚Äôm not really a coordinated or uncoordinated person. I‚Äôve never broken any bones or been seriously injured, so I‚Äôm not particularly clumsy. I don‚Äôt consider myself super graceful either though. I like playing instruments, so I‚Äôm good with my hands in that sense. I‚Äôm not very good at drawing though, and I don‚Äôt really enjoy tinkering with machinery.10. I‚Äôm very artistic. I write and perform my own music, and I like to come up with visual concepts for my music. I‚Äôm drawn to dreamy, kind of surrealistic imagery, I love old movies(black and white or technicolor). Color is really important to me, I‚Äôm profoundly affected and inspired by aesthetics.11. I tend to not think about the past unless there‚Äôs something I can learn from it, or unless I‚Äôm writing or creating something about what happened in the past. I like to make the most of the present because of the general uncertainty of the future. I try not to worry about the future, I‚Äôd rather do my best in the present.12. I have a hard time saying no when someone asks me for help with something, but I‚Äôve learned how to do that I can maintain my own sanity. I won‚Äôt help somebody if what they want me to do would enable them to be unhealthy. 13. Yeah I mean I guess. It can be frustrating when stuff doesn‚Äôt make sense.14. Productivity is important to me in the sense that I like to work towards my goals. If I don‚Äôt care about something, I don‚Äôt care too much about being productive and efficient.15. I‚Äôd like to think that I‚Äôm not a controlling person, although I can be if I super stressed out. It‚Äôs usually pretty indirect though, I can be rather passive aggressive.16. The activities I listed in number 6 are pretty much all my hobbies. Music is in there too.17. I suck at the whole standard academic structure. I have a hard time turning things in on time if I‚Äôm taking a full class load. I get really overwhelmed and burnt out pretty quickly. If I don‚Äôt care about what I‚Äôm learning about, I just don‚Äôt really do it, which isn‚Äôt great. I kind of just need the freedom to do things in my own way in my own time. I can‚Äôt have anyone breathing down my neck and pressuring me either.18. I‚Äôm not very good at breaking things down into pieces and prioritizing them. I just do things in the order that makes sense to me in the way that feels right. I just go with my gut for the most part.19. I really want to make an impact on the world through music and art. Personally, I want to feel happy and fulfilled. I want to be intellectually and creatively stimulated. I want to give love and be loved.20. I‚Äôm afraid of going insane, that‚Äôs a big fear of mine. Living a meaningless life and wasting my time and potential is another huge fear. I hate being bored, feeling stuck and uninspired, and feeling like I don‚Äôt have the option to live life the way that I want to.21. The highs in my life have involved positivity, acceptance, excitement, creative inspiration and productivity. There‚Äôs been a lot of positive spontaneity, and I‚Äôve been surrounded by like minded people who I‚Äôve bonded with.22. The lows in my life look like pretty much like the opposite of my highs. They‚Äôve been filled with depression, anxiety, boredom, a lack of creativity, and crippling loneliness.23. I tend to do both of those things. I‚Äôm aware of my surroundings while I daydream, usually my surroundings have some influence on my daydreams.24. I‚Äôd probably wonder how I go to that room and why I‚Äôm there. I‚Äôd probably just observe and take it all in, and then figure out what I should do, if anything.25. It depends on what the decision is. I‚Äôll usually consider and weigh the options and pick the one that makes the most sense. I usually don‚Äôt change my mind after I‚Äôve made an important decision because I trust my gut in picking the right path.26. I take a really long time to process emotions because I sometimes have trouble knowing why I‚Äôm feeling something, or what exactly it is that I‚Äôm feeling. Emotions are important to me, but I have a love/hate relationship with them. I don‚Äôt like being bogged down by negative emotions and being unable to get out of that rut.27. It depends if it‚Äôs worth it for me to agree with them. Sometimes I‚Äôm just so over it with a conversation that I‚Äôll agree just so the person stops talking. If I enjoy the conversation and the person I‚Äôm talking to, I‚Äôll express my actual opinion on the topic, whether that‚Äôs in agreement with them or not.28. I‚Äôm not a huge rule breaker, I‚Äôve never been in trouble with the law or anything like that. But if the rules are corrupt, then I think it‚Äôs okay to break the rules for the sake of the greater good. If the authority is corrupt or ignoring thhe will or wellbeing of the people, then I think that authority should be challenged.","I think I might be an esfp, can you read this and let me know what you

1168,1,"Hi everyone!! I answered the questionnaire at r/MbtiTypeMe and someone said they think I might be an ESFP based on my answers. Id love to hear your feedback on whether you think they were right or wrong! 1. I‚Äôm a 22 year old woman, I‚Äôm relatively short, in decent shape, and I really like wearing make-up. My natural hair color is brown, but I‚Äôve had purple, blonde, and red hair at different points over the past year or so.2.

old movie black and white or technicolor color is really important to me i‚Äôm profoundly affected and inspired by aesthetic 11 i tend to not think about the past unless there‚Äôs something i can learn from it or unless i‚Äôm writing or creating something about what happened in the past i like to make the most of the present because of the general uncertainty of the future i try not to worry about the future i‚Äôd rather do my best in the present 12 i have a hard time saying no when someone asks me for help with something but i‚Äôve learned how to do that i can maintain my own sanity i won‚Äôt help somebody if what they want me to do would enable them to be unhealthy 13 yeah i mean i guess it can be frustrating when stuff doesn‚Äôt make sense 14 productivity is important to me in the sense that i like to work towards my goal if i don‚Äôt care about something i don‚Äôt care too much about being productive and efficient 15 i‚Äôd like to think that i‚Äôm not a controlling person although i can be if i super stressed out it‚Äôs usually pretty indirect though i can be rather passive aggressive 16 the activity i listed in number 6 are pretty much all my hobby music is in there too 17 i suck at the whole standard academic structure i have a hard time turning thing in on time if i‚Äôm taking a full class load i get really overwhelmed and burnt out pretty quickly if i don‚Äôt care about what i‚Äôm learning about i just don‚Äôt really do it which isn‚Äôt great i kind of just need the freedom to do thing in my own way in my own time i can‚Äôt have anyone breathing down my neck and pressuring me either 18 i‚Äôm not very good at breaking thing down into piece and prioritizing them i just do thing in the order that make sense to me in the way that feel right i just go with my gut for the most part 19 i really want to make an impact on the world through music and art personally i want to feel happy and fulfilled i want to be intellectually and creatively stimulated i want to give love and be loved 20 i‚Äôm afraid of going insane that‚Äôs a big fear of mine living a meaningless life and wasting my time and potential is another huge fear i hate being bored stuck and uninspired and like i don‚Äôt have the option to live life the way that i want to 21 the high in my life have involved positivity acceptance excitement creative inspiration and productivity there‚Äôs been a lot of positive spontaneity and i‚Äôve been surrounded by like minded people who i‚Äôve bonded with 22 the low in my life look like pretty much like the opposite of my high they‚Äôve been filled with depression anxiety boredom a lack of creativity and crippling loneliness 23 i tend to do both of those thing i‚Äôm aware of my surroundings while i daydream usually my surroundings have some influence on my daydream 24 i‚Äôd probably wonder how i go to that room and why i‚Äôm there i‚Äôd probably just observe and take it all in and then figure out what i should do if anything 25 it depends on what the decision is i‚Äôll usually consider and weigh the option and pick the one that make the most sense i usually don‚Äôt change my mind after i‚Äôve made an important decision because i trust my gut in picking the right path 26 i take a really long time to process emotion because i sometimes have trouble knowing why i‚Äôm something or what exactly it is that i‚Äôm emotion are important to me but i have a love hate relationship with them i don‚Äôt like being bogged down by negative emotion and being unable to get out of that rut 27 it depends if it‚Äôs worth it for me to agree with them sometimes i‚Äôm just so over it with a conversation that i‚Äôll agree just so the person stop talking if i enjoy the conversation and the person i‚Äôm talking to i‚Äôll express my actual opinion on the topic whether that‚Äôs in agreement with them or not 28 i‚Äôm not a huge rule breaker i‚Äôve never been in trouble with the law or anything like that but if the rule are corrupt then i think it‚Äôs okay to break the rule for the sake of the greater good if the authority is corrupt or ignoring thhe will or wellbeing of the people then i think that authority should be

A 'live and let live' approach that also welcomes (kind!) others with open arms.I love how inactive your sub is, if only because I have a gut feeling most of you are out experiencing life rather than ruminating over it. All I can say is *thank you* for those beautiful, rare moments you take a moment to talk to withdrawn and aloof-seeming folks like myself, and make our days brighter with your kindness, empathy, and unshakeable desire to enjoy yourself and your life.Thanks for coming to my TED talk, you're all beautiful people!Sincerely,\-Practical M.",Love letter to ESFPs from an INFJ,dear s you are all genius of the physical realm i have never met a healthy that wasn t willing to see the best of thing or try to have fun no matter how difficult life get i ve been fortunate to have had an partner for 4 year who ha treated me with kindness and grace nonal a he push me face first into the grindstone of life and tell me to live dammit live and i think we all need someone like that in our life infjs frequently tout them ourselves a wanting to save or change the world in significant way and i see s a being the goal of what people should be a a result of changing the world in the present utterly expressive shameless for oneself and nonal toward others a live and let live approach that also welcome kind others with open arm i love how inactive your sub is if only because i have a gut most of you are out experiencing life rather than ruminating over it all i can say is thank you for those beautiful rare moment you take a moment to talk to withdrawn and aloof seeming folk like myself and make our day brighter with your kindness empathy and unshakeable desire to enjoy yourself and your life thanks for coming to my ted talk you re all beautiful people sincerely practical m love letter to s from an infj,1229,242,0.034,0.249,0.718,0.9963

It ended up not working out between us because he had been so hurt by a previous break-up that he didn't want to be in a relationship and he wasn't doing well in school and really wanted to focus on that.

We hug and I congratulate him and he says he's moving to my neighborhood. He tells me that we should hang out, go climbing together etc. I say ok, am in a bit a shock.I don't reach out for months because I didn't really have a need or want to.

1210,1,"So there's this guy (20 M ESFP) who I've known for about six months now and it's getting blatantly obvious that he has a crush on me (18 F ENFP). This guy is a lot of fun and I enjoy hanging out with him, but I've never really developed feelings for him and I hadn't thought about him like *that* until I realised what was going on back in May. You guys are so over the top and usually I love it, but now that all that energy is being directed solely at me it's beginning to freak me out a little. I know you guys are naturally flirty (we ENFPs are too!) but I'm about 110% sure this guy likes me. The touching, the teasing, the fact he manages to sit next to me every time the squad hangs out, the 1000000 not-so-subtle compliments I've received, the fact his IQ drops down to about 5 every time I walk in the room and he seems unable to form a full sentence whenever I'm near him. The other day when we were leaving he jumped in the back of my car, moved my stuff, put his seatbelt on, and was fully ready to come home with me and my two friends. He wanted to go to a lookout or something? He just wanted to hang out some more I think. I had to very clearly tell him no about three times before he actually got out again. He tried it again the next time we hung out and I was like NO before he even sat down and I think he got the message. I don't know what to do with him because he hasn't actually asked me out yet. I feel like I can't just go up to him and be like please stop liking me, I don't reciprocate. He's probably aware of it. I've told him to please stop hugging me, please move over a bit so I have some space, please stop randomly *getting in my car* and he's listened, but without fail he always manages to find some new method. Me being an ENFP means I'm always just a bit too friendly with everyone and I've tried to tone it down a lot with him but when I'm in the moment I'll completely forget that I'm trying to tone it down and I go back to super friendly ENFP mode. Anyway my question is, what do I *do* with him? No one has ever been this forthright with me before and to start off with it was kind of adorable but now it's getting annoying. I really did try my best to see if I could develop feelings for him but I just... can't. There's no spark on my end. The rest of the squad thinks we would be cute together and I'm not getting any sympathy or help from them. If anything they're just making it worse by trying to set us up all the time.

1229,1,"Hi, could you tell me which type I belong the most?‚Ä¢ How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.22, Male, Business Student. ‚Ä¢ Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?I don't think I have any problems, at least as a child I was hyper active and didn't like sitting for too long, but it happened when I was with other people and not at home if I was alone with my parents.Perhaps I was also looking for attention. ‚Ä¢ What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?I‚Äôm a Business student and I chose this degree because I‚Äòm interested in an important role at managerial level.‚Ä¢ If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?If I have any goals or interests to reach I would have no trouble spending a few weekends alone, but after a while I would need to go out, working out, play sports or something else. ‚Ä¢ What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?Before the University I played football every weekend, but then I stopped.Now I go to the gym.I don‚Äôt like mountain trip or something like that unless I have a strong interest. ‚Ä¢ How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?I'm curious, I like to inform and know, but only if interested in the topic.I could spend many hours in research, have maximum 3-5 ideas, it depends on the topic and they arise after doing research and having thought about it, generally I tend to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù what I find more than ""inventing"".As a child I liked to draw, but more than inventing I copied what I saw.  When I played the piano I was asked to compose a song, but I wasn't very good at inventing from nothing.I was very curious about nature, animals and science and spent many hours looking for information and I also had encyclopedias.  Even during adolescence I tended to look for topics of my interest and photocopy the pages to put them in a binder.‚Ä¢ Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?From an early age I always wanted to be at the center, to feel like the leader and still today I want to be at the center of decisions, I was and I am very stubborn when it comes to deciding something and it often bothers me if others don't do what I want.Sometimes I immediately make this clear, while sometimes I avoid it if it's not really necessary, but during childhood and adolescence I was prone to anger more often.I think I'd be good, maybe I inspire confidence, but at the same time I could be a little too much ‚Äúmy way or nothing‚Äù.Sometimes I could satisfy the needs of others, but at other times I am very firm about my decisions.‚Ä¢ Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?On an athletic level yes, I always liked running, playing soccer and doing bodybuilding and bodyweight, but I'm better at a physical level than in team sports because I often played in an individualistic way to be at the center.I am very competitive, I want to win and if I lose I could act childish.‚Ä¢Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.As a child I liked to draw, I didn't invent but I copied what I liked.‚Ä¢ What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?I have always thought of the future, setting a goal and ""dreaming"" of reaching it.Sometimes I imagine future scenarios and I think about how to act in those cases.I could enjoy the moment when I‚Äôm in company, but I prefer to think of the future rather than the past.Especially now. As a child I already thought that I wanted to become a doctor and at secondary school I had already decided to start the Scientific High School to have a good foundation for the University.After a short internship I realized that I didn't really want it, but I preferred to be in a higher position and I decided to study Economics.‚Ä¢ How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?It depends what they ask me and if I'm busy doing anything else.I could be ready to help or it could irritate me. ‚Ä¢ Do you need logical consistency in your life?Yes I rely on facts, I‚Äôm stubborn and skeptical and I don‚Äôt change my mind if I am not given a good reason to do so.‚Ä¢ How important is efficiency and productivity to you?When I want something I inform myself and try to have it as soon as possible.I hate wasting time and it could irritate me if I slow down especially if one thing interests me.But I always procrastinated when it came to studying.Until secondary school I was a good student, but then I started procrastinating. ‚Ä¢ Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?It depends.If we have to do something I want it done in a certain way.I could let them do or give them directions, but it irritates me to know if they don't.‚Ä¢ What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?Sports and gym.I played soccer, but it hasn't been a passion since childhood like many I know.  I started at age 13 and dreamed of becoming a footballer, but when I realized that it wouldn't happen, I immediately abandoned.I started gym inspired by Bruce Lee, I started doing research on his training and I followed him for a year, then I decided for a more muscular physique and I did other research and I wrote my own workout.I don't like it when I'm not training and I thought this was a passion, but I realized that it's more a means to reach my goal.‚Ä¢ What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?It depends on the subject.For Sciences, Literature, History and Philosophy I prefer to read and then be able to express myself, while for Mathematics I prefer concrete examples.I don't like to memorize, I want to understand ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and I don‚Äôt like to study just because it‚Äôs imposed. ‚Ä¢ How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?I like to think of a strategy, even in football I played that way and told others what to do: a kind of player-coach.I also really liked Risiko, a board game based on the military conquest of the territories.  Even in the gym I follow a workout in a precise manner and it is designed to do the result I want.  At school I like it less, but I try to organize myself.I don't really like improvising and I prefer to have an initial idea or base to start with.I could be able based on the situation, but I often get irritated when something goes wrong.‚Ä¢ What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?As a child I wanted to be a doctor and already from secondary school I decided to study Scientific High School and then Medicine.  I don't know why, I liked science and studying the human body and maybe I also liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbeing able to treat people.  During adolescence with a passion for football I started thinking about becoming a footballer, but when I realized that it was not possible I left.  At 18 years after a brief internship in hospital I decided to leave because I realized that it was not for me, but I preferred a different place where I could organize and coordinate others and have a more important role at managerial level, Aldo inspired by figures like Steve Jobs, and now I‚Äôm studying Business.‚Ä¢ What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?Being useless, not exploiting my potential and failing my goals.‚Ä¢ What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?I wouldn't know exactly.When I get what I want, when I reach a result even if just reached it becomes ""insignificant"" and i think I want more, when I play soccer and when I go out with friends.‚Ä¢ What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?When I want something but I can't get it or when I fail in somenthing I really want. ‚Ä¢ How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?Sometimes I imagine the future, what could happen, I think about my goals and imagine what it would be like to reach them.Or I just think about what could happen and think about what I could do.‚Ä¢Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?I don't know and it's not something I‚Äôm interested in thinking about.‚Ä¢ How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?I like to inform myself, learn about the various alternatives and come to a conclusion.If it‚Äôs a very important decision I could think about it for a while, but I would like to come to a conclusion right away.The same thing happens when others are thinking: I am impatient and I want to get to the end.When I make a decision I‚Äôm quite determined and stubborn even at the cost of making a mistake.‚Ä¢ How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?Difficult subject, I wouldn't know what to say and I rarely stop to think about it.  During a relationship it‚Äôs difficult for me to express emotionally, perhaps I tend to impose a logic while trying to express myself.I could become attached to someone, but losing it never caused me any major problems.I have always been reserved about it and rarely talk about it. ‚Ä¢ Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?I was told that I‚Äôm very stubborn and that I always want to be right and often I also lost my temper and I was prone to anger. Sometimes I almost don't realize it, for me it's normal to do so.A few times I decided to bite my tongue to avoid arguing: in those cases I preferred silence or I left.‚Ä¢ Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?I follow the rules, but I'm ready to break them if I find them stupid or if I want to obtain something.I respect authorities, but at the same time they must earn this respect.",ENTJ or ESFP?,hi could you tell me which type i belong the most ‚Ä¢ how old are you what s your gender give u a general description of yourself 22 male business student ‚Ä¢ is there a

In real life I wouldn't be as confident to act like i do online.. I guess that's a good thing from keeping me out of trouble. But the drive is still there, my desire to be noticed by people is far from gone. I've acted hyper irl several times, and it never ended well. I got ignored, ridiculed, persecuted, bullied, and even confronted for what they call as misbehaviour. I might not be an INTP, but i just can't help but notice how the INTP chat is much more loose and tolerating towards people like me. I want something to be proud of, yet lack the ambition to get it. So i started dwelling on my internal side, trying to convince myself that i have something to be proud of, like a high iq. I also seek much more things from the material world than most intps, and i also like physical affection a lot more than verbal affection.. i might just be an esfp, i guess from now on i'll adjust myself from being a hyper edgy androgynous nerd into something society itself is familiar with.

I have really little interest on actually reading and understanding the news, but much more on 'what others might perceive me as'. Although I know deep down that my classmates aren't really interested nor impressed by my things, i just can't help but to satisfy my desire... And in the process i feel a bit uncomfortable and a bit embarrassed because i know that my classmates would just perceive me as 'someone dumb who wants to get noticed for being out there'I am used on 'American' things nowFor example, I have zero interest on keeping up with news of my country's, because i consider most of them to be barbaric and uncivilized in nature, too chaotic and close minded etc...

1269,1,"Hi guys! 18F Enfj here! I'm wondering if you could help me with some insight on an ESFP guy friend of mine! So, here's the situation: We met at the beginning of this semester in college and he was actually the one to initiate that we hangout sometime (he did this 2x, actually) after meeting for the first time and chatting a bit. He embodies the ESFP so acutely: He is charming, talented (he taught himself to play the piano and he does so splendidly!), he is adventurous, spontaneous, good at reading people, an intellectual, etc. So over a period of 3-5 weeks, we got really close. He was inspired to to take a year off college to do some traveling around the U.S. and ultimately go to France to learn more about the culture/language/people. I had my suspicions that he liked me more as a friend, but he has also had some petty high school drama with girls so that's why he hasn't taken much interest in them in college. He actually called me his only girl friend here at college. Here are some other signs I thought he liked me (and please let me know if I'm reading these correctly): ‚Ä¢ He compliments me quite a lot, saying that I'm an influencer and that I'm going to do big things, change the world, I'm a good dancer, have a way with words, good poet, good fashion sense, good at reading people (psychoanalysis is sorta what we do A LOT), etc.‚Ä¢ He says I help him be better and since meeting him, I've seen him mature more as we talk and I express things that may be rude or irritating to others and he takes it to heart and works almost immediately to check himself - For ex. He would ask me a question but never let me say, in full, my thoughts. So I expressed to him in a tactful way how that was rude and frustrating and he became very conscience of this since then and let's me say my piece.‚Ä¢ He says he never gives hugs but he knows how much of a hugger I am so he made an exception ‚Ä¢ I was going through some tough times with other friends and I think he tried to console me the best way he could: - hearing me out- giving me the objectivity/sound advice I needed with my emotions being askew- offering me whiskey (imma whiskey kinda gal, what can I say? üòå) - he was actually saving the whiskey for the boys, but gave me another glass because he felt bad and apparently I looked like I needed it- he talks to me about whatever is on his mind, whether it be the latest idea he has, his family, his upcoming trip to France, etc.- he seems to trust me enough to want my opinion on things, whether it be on clothes (he actually had me go to the mall with him to pick out a wardrobe) or my thoughts on people- he actually let me pick out his outfits for the day a couple times* I could say more, but you get the pictureAnyways, so I tell him how I feel about him in two forms: a long message and a poem (which really showed the hopeless romantic in me) I'm quite nervous I might've scared him off because he's been more distant with me (we actually haven't hung out since my confession). We have texted but his are always brief so I match his style when texting back. He basically told me that I was a good poet and that he's not looking for anything right now, which is fair. I just can't help but wonder if he doesn't want to initiate something given his past drama with girls (though he has admitted that I'm a ""smart"" one and mature)? I also wonder if it has something to do with him leaving next month? He's just demonstrated in so many ways that I'm unique to him or at the very least, he cares for me. He wishes to just stay good friends but he's the one making it awkward. To demonstrate that I'm cool with his decision, I asked to hang out along with some other messages and he replied to all of them (in short, concise messages, of course) but that one. I also made sure to add that I wasn't expecting for us to be a couple or anything with titles. I just wanted to continue on the trajectory of our friendship by doing what we always do: talk, listen to music, go on spontaneous trips/walks. I acknowledged that I wanted to be closer to him, but only of he wanted it too. I told him time and time again that I have no intention of keeping him from setting off on his journey and that I am, indeed, happy and excited for him.In my poem, I asked him in several ways to please not do what he's doing now: not letting me know what's on his mind or how he truly feels. I feel he's being very objective, kinda cold, but still composed and cool in demeanor like he usually is. Has he caught feels for me and is freaking out about it? Or am I just delusional and overthinking it? Any advice is helpful. I know I'm asking a lot. TL,DR: I, a female ENFJ, told my good guy friend who is an ESFP that I had feelings for him and now he's being distant. We hung out all the time but now our communication has been reduced to brief concise texts. I'm not making it weird, but he sure is. He said he just wanted to be friends and I respect that, but I cannot help but think he's probably scared. For a guy that's never at a loss for words and gives frequent monologues, he's awfully closed in sharing his thoughts with me on this whole situation. Though he has expressed in many ways that I am a pretty awesome girl, he hasn't told me how he feels about me aside from just wanting to be friends and that he's not looking for anything right now. - Sorry!

LMAO](https://youtu.be/KKBLmMB70DA)So I found a good middle ground at ESFJ - And to confirm it, I was verified over a video chat and got typed as an *obvious* ESFJ, and  ESFJ pretty much accounts for everything. My massive Si tendincies I'm always talking about, the resteraunt stuff and the nostalgic recalling dates from the past, and I tend to base my descisions off the past too, like if I knew that this particular resteraunt has some nasty broken soda mechine, I won't order soda there, things like that. ESFJ also has Ne, just not dominant, but it's there enough to explain why I kept getting barraged with ENFP typings lol. And the inferior Ti would explain why I'm pretty bad at logical consistency, people have pointed that out to me a lot too. **But about the Fe.** People have pointed out that in my questionnaires I mention appreciating a good social atomosphere, that's lively, cheerful and accepting, and accepts me for who I am, and it sounds very Fe. Wanting to interact with people especially on discord, caring about twitter followers, wanting to be chill and not control anybody - sounds like Fe. But the thing I don't relate to, is Fe being good at creating social circles, reading the room, being good with social cues, and being well liked by most. I am a cringelord for crying out loud, ever since elementary school I've been kind of lowkey outcasted, because I'd always overdo it with expressing my obsessions or meme references or whatever. My family also gets on my ass a LOT about acting socially inappropriate, and I've actually been banned from some places. I'm trying to work on that, but my point is it doesn't come *naturally,* like a dominant function should. I'm far from a popular social butterfly, the closest thing I'll be to that is typology discord lmao. I believe that everyone has the right to live their life their own way, we're not here to control each other, nobody is less than as a human, the world (especially cities haha) is a beautiful place, and I see no need for social games, gaslighting or any form of malicious manipulation, I just want to live my life with people I love and do what I love. Does this support or go against Fe? They seem to be very big traits, just like how Se dom have these big traits, and I would just like to know if it's that big of a deal to worry about, or if they actually end up supporting my type.

1306,1,"I‚Äôm a single female ESFP in college. I LOVE going out to parties with my friends, meeting new people and just having a good time. It brings me so much joy and I have so much fun and why bother paying for college if I‚Äôm not going to get the most out of it?  (Partying does not come before my school work, don‚Äôt worry.)Now the thing is, I‚Äôm also a prop assistant for the musical the college theater department is putting on. That means I‚Äôm responsible for helping make props, going to all of the dress rehearsals, and being at all of the showings. At the shows I have to help get props on and off stage at the right time. Not too hard, right?  Except now that I‚Äôve gotten a schedule of when I‚Äôm supposed to be there, it‚Äôs a ridiculous amount of time commitment and interferes with two things I‚Äôve been planning and looking forward to for a long time. This Friday and every night next week I‚Äôm supposed to be there from 5:30 Pm - 10 Pm and this weekend and next weekend I‚Äôm supposed be there 10am-10pmNow here‚Äôs the thing, St Patrick‚Äôs day is this Sunday and it‚Äôs one of the two best party days of the semester. The cops are paid off and festivities go from 10am-6pm, and shit gets W I L D. I‚Äôm going to be a floor advisor next year and I‚Äôll only be 20 so if I go out I‚Äôll lose my job and free room, and I‚Äôm also graduating so I won‚Äôt have another chance to go out on st Patrick‚Äôs day. I haven‚Äôt gone out on saint Patrick‚Äôs day before and I really really want to experience it and this years my only chance. Now in addition to that there‚Äôs a rave next Friday that I‚Äôve been planning on going to for literally a year. The problem is the shows also on that Friday and the other props assistant is completely incompetent and I don‚Äôt want to leave all of the responsibility on the props master who is also one of my close friends. I made these commitments and even though I didn‚Äôt realize how much it was going to be, I should really stick to it.  But I‚Äôm also doing this purely for extra curricular, and everyone else there is theater majors/minors and getting class credit for all of this. Skipping out for parties would be selfish and the entire theater department would be pissed at me. However if I skip out on the parties my other friends will be pissed at me, I‚Äôll be out the $30 for my rave ticket,and I‚Äôm really going to regret missing them. I live for these sort of life experiences and they make up a lot of my favorite memories. No matter what I do, I‚Äôm going to feel guilty and a lot of my friends are going to be upset. I figure that means I might as well do what I want to go and actually enjoy myself, but that would also make me a bad/selfish person. I‚Äôm young and want to embrace the chance to be irresponsible and have fun while I still can. I don‚Äôt know what to do :( TLDR:  I made a commitment that‚Äôs way more time and energy than I expected and means I have to cancel plans for two days that I‚Äôve been planning for a very long time and really looking forward to.

1372,1,"So, I don't know for sure, but he kind of fits the bill for it and I'm trying to gauge the best way to deal with our impending divorce.   I'm an ENTJ woman; I've always been the bread winner, always been the one with high expectations, driven, pushing him to be better, helping him with college, the military (I got him enlisted because it helped me), etc. I'm pretty sure the pushing finally got to a point where he couldn't take it anymore and we both just started losing respect for one another and couldn't communicate anymore due to him always taking everything I said as criticism and it was to the point that I used the same tactic I usually do with discuss of divorce and told him to leave and he finally did. He had enough. He's done.   I didn't realize he was really done though, so within a few days I'm trying to talk to him like we're just fighting per the usual, got us in counseling, we had some fights, and then 17 days after leaving, he was sleeping with someone else. Loyalty is a big deal for ENTJ's so this caused me to flip and go on the extreme aggressive side of things which included some vengeance, upping the ante, and of course none of that helped. But why - you ask - would I even want to bother with someone who is dead set on being done? Because we have kids. And part of what made me flip so hard besides the loyalty is that he wasn't really invested in seeing them during that time because he's too caught up in living in the moment.   Well, that girl lasted from Oct 17th to roughly Nov 11 and the last I heard they saw each other was Nov 26. By Nov 28th, he met a new girl and he's only known her for all of 10 days but things seem to be going well there and he's been staying over there frequently. During this time, he has only seen the kids 6 times (Mainly in Oct) and that's on both of us (I got petty on some stuff and he decided to concede everything to letting a court handle the situation).   I don't know if this is normal behavior for a ESFP type person but I do know he has a habit of basically hopping into a new relationship very fast to get over an old one and has a unique ability to just drop people when he wants. So I'm curious if this behavior fits the mold or if it's a different personality type. He's got great charm, charisma, likes to be the center of attention and is constantly changing his appearance to fit whatever job he's in (currently he's becoming more of a country guy and his new dig is quite country herself).   And if he is ESFP - what is the best way for someone with a more aggressive personality type to find common ground? We both currently have an issue with trust, but I need to re-establish at least some basic level of trust in order to work towards co-parenting with him.   We have a custody hearing on Thursday and until tonight, he and I hadn't spoken or seen each other in a month, but I'm the pushy type so I sought him out. With all the deep diving I've been doing into my own personality type, we were able to have a much needed civil discussion of my expectations that his ""living in the moment"" doesn't affect our children and that he doesn't let the flings ever take priority over them. He seemed to agree, assured me he could ""drop them"" if it ever became an issue, but was reserved to admit his habits of going out and partying all the time because he likely feels like it's something I'd jump on and criticize. Which I likely would because he also complains of not having money when he just bought a 2018 car and is funding the attorney since he's the one who filed for divorce.   Either way - I just want to find the best way to move forward and understand him better so that I'm not causing the same waves I did with our previous relationship.       &amp;#x200B;",I think my husband is an ESFP,so i don t know for sure but he kind of fit the bill for it and i m trying to gauge the best way to deal with our impending divorce i m an entj woman i ve always been the bread winner always been the one with high expectation driven pushing him to be better helping him with college the military i got him enlisted because it helped me etc i m pretty sure the pushing finally got to a point where he couldn t take it anymore and we both just started losing respect for one another and couldn t communicate anymore due to him always taking everything i said a criticism and it wa to the point that i used the same tactic i usually do with discus of divorce and told him to leave and he finally did he had enough he s done i didn t realize he wa really done though so within a few day i m trying to talk to him like we re just fighting per the usual got u in counseling we had some fight and then 17 day after leaving he wa sleeping with someone else loyalty is a big deal for entj s so this caused me to flip and go on the extreme aggressive side of thing which included some vengeance upping the ante and of course none of that helped but why you ask would i even want to bother with someone who is dead set on being done because we have kid and part of what made me flip so hard besides the loyalty is that he wasn t really invested in seeing them during that time because he s too caught up in living in the moment well that girl lasted from oct 17th to roughly nov 11 and the last i heard they saw each other wa nov 26 by nov 28th he met a new girl and he s only known her for all of 10 day but thing seem to be going well there and he s been staying over there frequently during this time he ha only seen the kid 6 time mainly in oct and that s on both of u i got petty on some stuff and he decided to concede everything to letting a court handle the situation i don t know if this is normal behavior for a type person but i do know he ha a habit of basically hopping into a new relationship very fast to get over an old one and ha a unique ability to just drop people when he want so i m curious if this behavior fit the mold or if it s a different personality type he s got great charm charisma like to be the center of attention and is constantly changing his appearance to fit whatever job he s in currently he s becoming more of a country guy and his new dig is quite country herself and if he is what is the best way for someone with a more aggressive personality type to find common ground we both currently have an issue with trust but i need to re establish at least some basic level of trust in order to work towards co parenting with him we have a custody hearing on thursday and until tonight he and i hadn t spoken or seen each other in a month but i m the pushy type so i sought him out with all the deep diving i ve been doing into my own personality type we were able to have a much needed civil discussion of my expectation that his living in the moment doesn t affect our child and that he doesn t let the fling ever take priority over them he seemed to agree assured me he could drop them if it ever became an issue but wa reserved to admit his habit of going out and partying all the time because he likely feel like it s something i d jump on and criticize which i likely would because he also complains of not having money when he just bought a 2018 car and is funding the attorney since he s the one who filed for divorce either way i just want to find the best way to move forward and understand him better so that i m not causing the same wave i did with our previous relationship amp x200b i think my husband is an,3644,754,0.055,0.15,0.796,0.998

1380,1,"Hi, 20 yr old ISFP here. Guy is 22 yr old ESFP. (Long post and a little nsfw, sorry!) I‚Äôve known this esfp since may 2017. We met on Tinder. We were purely platonic friends for 2 months (he knew my past experiences with guy friends and sex were not good, so he said we didn‚Äôt have to have sex) before *I* was the one who admitted I wanted to have sex with him. He agreed to it. Best sex ever, each and every time since then. Sexual chemistry was crazy. Outside of sex, we just hunt out, talked about our current lives, went out to eat sometimes. When things were clearly getting rough for him, I told him that if he ever needed to talk to me, I‚Äôd be there for him. (That ISFP loyalty y‚Äôall.) He seemed to appreciate this.By Christmas 2017 I developed mild feelings for him and gave him a small present. He was so grateful he almost cried, wouldn‚Äôt stop hugging and thanking me. I told him it wasn‚Äôt a big deal (because I didn‚Äôt want to get my hopes up) but he insisted it was a huge deal to him. He started kissing me and I was hesitant. But I fell for him, and we had romantic sex. After that I was 90% sure that he liked me. Then I confessed to him on Instagram and was rejected, in somewhat of a douchey way. He said I was just sort of boring. Ouch. I blocked him on IG hoping to never speak to him again.He hit me up via text during summer 2018 (I forgot I gave him my number) asking me where I went and that he wanted to see me again. I frustratedly replied that HE was the one who said I was boring. He apologized and said he was depressed over a different girl at the time and took it out on me. When I saw him, and asked me if he wanted to tell me anything, he smiled huge and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs just really nice seeing you again.‚ÄùAt that point I didn‚Äôt even really care how he felt about me, nor whether or not he was lying. I just wanted to sleep with him again. Every time we did it, he was SO good, always going the extra mile, and telling me ‚ÄúGod you‚Äôre so hot‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou just look so good, I wanna go again‚Äù, etc so I knew for a fact he‚Äôs attracted to me. We‚Äôd fuck like bunnies. So we just kept doing that until a few weeks ago.I was afraid where this was going and didn‚Äôt trust him so I put a halt to the sex. I told him if he wants to keep hanging out with me as a friend that he can, but if he doesn‚Äôt want to then I‚Äôd understand. He said he‚Äôd miss the sex but would be down for seeing me as friends, and would make plans with me soon....I honestly didn‚Äôt expect a message from him after that. After 2 weeks since we last met, he messaged me today asking me if I saw this movie, and I said no. He asked me if I wanted to see it with him, and asked if he could come over tomorrow. (He actually wanted to see me today, but I declined because it was too sudden.) I said sure, but reminded him that I‚Äôd just moved and there‚Äôs still literally nothing to do at my apartment. He said he loves my apartment just the way it is, and said ‚Äúnot to worry‚Äù since he will bring multiplayer games. And yes, he was really nice about it. I‚Äôm just so confused. So he wants to hang. But didn‚Äôt he say I was too boring?? Does he feels bad or something ? Or is this a ploy to fuck ? What is going on through his head ??P.S. I‚Äôm not expecting anything good to come out of this.

I labeled Se DESCRIPTION 1 and Ne DESCRIPTION 2. The things I italicized are what they found apply to me.&amp;#x200B;**DESCRIPTION 1**&amp;#x200B;*‚Äì Are adaptable and easy-going**‚Äì Are realistic and down-to-earth**‚Äì Are practical and matter-of-fact**‚Äì Are excited by adventure and¬†thrills**‚Äì Live ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù and prefer to focus on the here-and-now**‚Äì Are fond of concrete facts and are aware of details**‚Äì Learn best from hands-on experience**‚Äì Seek stimulation by experiencing life in a hands-on, immersive way**‚Äì Have a ‚Äúlive and let live‚Äù mentality**‚Äì Tend to be impulsive and trust their impulses**‚Äì Are fun-loving and optimistic**‚Äì Pride themselves on being bold, unconventional, and spontaneous**‚Äì Prize freedom**‚Äì See all the details around them*&amp;#x200B;**DESCRIPTION 2**‚Äì Are always thinking of possibilities and what ‚Äúcould be‚Äù‚Äì Focus on the future much more than the present*‚Äì Are original and independent*‚Äì Love to start and initiate creative projects, but struggle with completing projects*‚Äì Work in bursts of impulsive energy**‚Äì Hate routine*‚Äì Seek and trust inspiration and are willing to follow it anywhere.*‚Äì Tend to be enthusiastic and good with people*‚Äì Love to inspire and motivate others*‚Äì Find hidden patterns, possibilities, and potentials*‚Äì See so many alternatives that they can have trouble focusing on just one thing‚Äì Are open-minded and slow to form premature conclusions‚Äì See things in impressions and focus on ‚Äúthe big picture‚Äù&amp;#x200B;And based on this I was going ....uhhhhh, when did I ever believe I was ENFP lmao?&amp;#x200B;Because if we're going by the straight, basic traditional definitions of MBTI sensing/intuition, I don't really fall into the ""big picture focused, future-oriented, abstract"" category of intuition. If we just step back for a second, the [very first description I posted about myself on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/94v2ob/type_me_from_the_description_i_wrote_about_myself/), I'm not sure if it embodies what you would call ""stereotypical Ne traits,"" like what I mentioned above. This is a huge reason why I held strong to ESFP for 7 months, I am simply not intuitive under these terms and S/N was the absolute last letter I would've thought would change if I was mistyped.&amp;#x200B;But then we dig deeper into the functions. The Se traits of essentially taking things as they are and not really looking for a deeper meaning, just wanting to enjoy life and caring more about the present are about the extent of what I relate to. But the rest? It doesn't add up. Being adept with the environment, good at quickly taking action, good at and often asserts themselves socially, physically, wants material things to be happy, going out of their way to try new things, etc. Those may manifest in different ways and that's how stereotypes like partying, sports, skydiving etc are created. But the underlying motivation, which is what I'm trying my best to look at instead of the airhead stereotype behavior, does not add up.[http://www.practicalmbti.com/esfp](http://www.practicalmbti.com/esfp) [st=JP6DGWHE&amp;sh=db236ce8](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4tx9b5/se_a_better_fucking_explanation/?st=JP6DGWHE&amp;sh=db236ce8)&amp;#x200B;[https://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/155487328090/esfp-sefiteni](https://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/155487328090/esfp-sefiteni)&amp;#x200B;[http://possibilitywarrior.com/the-tao-of-type/se-extraverted-sensing/](http://possibilitywarrior.com/the-tao-of-type/se-extraverted-sensing/)&amp;#x200B;These are just a few examples, but do you see that similar kind of trend? And that happens with almost all of the Se descriptions I come by, and even when people are talking about Se in the most non-stereotypical way they can I still can't relate.. The whole aura, assertive sort of ""hyped up"" nature of Se doms don't really fit me and I find that the less forceful but more like enthusiastic and excited, hyped up but in a more passive and fan-girlish way nature of ENFPs fit me infinitely more.&amp;#x200B;Plus, based on what I relate to for Si a lot of people agree that this rules out Se dom.&gt;I have a tendency to order the same thing from restaurants, every single time, because I know it‚Äôs good and I don‚Äôt want to like ‚Äòwaste my trip‚Äô on something I might not like. I prefer comfort/stability over constantly trying new things.  Someone once asked me what my biggest problem in my life is. I answered this:  ‚ÄúI think the biggest issue in my life is not being able to really let go to certain things. I can‚Äôt let go of this certain part of my past, this certain group that the universe seems to be going out of its way to keep me away from them, and things that I‚Äôve gotten obsessed with, no matter how much it‚Äôs affecting my life there are certain things I just can‚Äôt let go.‚Äù  I am the most nostalgic person in my friend group by FAR. I have over 80,000 photos in my camera roll with countless memories and experiences I wish to cherish forever, and I refuse to delete ANY OF THEM. And if it‚Äôs an event that was especially important to me, I can easily tell you that we ate at McDonalds at this seat, I got bitten by fire ants on my right ankle, my friend X was there with a Samsung phone, all those details are crystal clear to me. I‚Äôm constantly going ‚ÄúOne year ago on this day X emotionally significant event happened‚Äù to my friends, I‚Äôve been doing it less lately because I realized that no one cares.. but no I don‚Äôt have a problem with memory at all. If anything it‚Äôs pretty good as long as I‚Äôm talking about something I care about. I also have a whole playlist full of nostalgic songs that take me back to the good old days, and I love listening to that sometimes.--  When I‚Äôm deeply involved in something, I find it really hard to take breaks to eat, shower etc. I know gross. I do get to it of course but once I‚Äôm doing something I don‚Äôt want to do anything else. Once I was walking downtown with my friends and because of my crippling FOMO I was holding in my need to use the bathroom for 5 hours and it eventually got so bad that I just had to haul butt over there. I feel pretty dumb sometimes because of that, especially when I get called out for it. ‚ÄúYou forgot to EAT?! How do you forget to eat????‚Äù And I can‚Äôt even give a reasonable explanation for it.  I don‚Äôt really have a problem losing stuff because I just shove everything in the same purse all the time.. but when it does happen, holy crap it is a mess. I throw everything out onto the floor and it‚Äôs just absolute chaos until I can find it. But thankfully that doesn‚Äôt happen too often.&amp;#x200B;Believe me, I have been trying for 7 months to hang onto ESFP and support it using only the basic things of Se I can relate to. But literally everything else does not add up. On the other hand, I find myself clicking and relating to more ENFPs than ESFPs, by fictional characters, internet, real life. After I started being more honest with my self description and included everything and not just the Se sounding parts, according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-P3cKWkEkgyWe4VsHQiQ_wwPCiAxZGqrUsFMZILyxbE/edit) the majority seem to agree that I don't have Se at all let alone dominant Se, and I'm more likely to be ENFP. After I thought about it, I realized that the Si, Fi, Extravert, and general nature just simply *fits* me all the way, and I don't feel like I have to write a certain way, only post certain traits, or twist crap around to relate to ENFPs, it just automatically *clicks* and just simply being myself is enough proof. My profile has a lot of evidence for this. I just simply don't relate to the intuitive part.This is where I'm having trouble at this point, I'm not sure if the reasons for thinking ESFP outweigh my the reasons for thinking ENFP or vice versa.. I feel like they are both equally compelling arguments and both are just as likely and I don't know where to go..

1402,1,"I‚Äôm fairly certain that I have Fi, but unsure if it‚Äôs dominant or auxiliary. I wrote a description of myself awhile back that was based on how others saw me, traits I saw in myself, and tried to cover different areas in my life. I got mixed results, a lot of ESFP and INFP. I‚Äôve read about both and I can easily see myself as both, but I know I can only possibly be one, and I‚Äôm stumped trying to find out. I‚Äôll make my case for each and try to include my motivations as well.  **My main reasons for INFP** are the Fi-Si loop: I‚Äòm sentimental and nostalgic about certain events in my past and love sharing them because I‚Äôm not ready to let them go, and I‚Äôd like to think those around me care as much as I do. I have a lot of photos and remember the specific dates of the events that were emotionally relevant for me, again because I don‚Äôt want to forget, I believe that they aren‚Äôt truly gone unless you forget about them. I don‚Äôt care about my appearance as much, I obviously take care of hygiene but I rarely deviate from my normal clothing style because it‚Äôs comfortable, that and because I freaking hate clothes shopping in general haha. I don‚Äôt display a lot of your average Se traits, I‚Äôm pretty clumsy and uncharismatic, and you could see my cringe-worthy and awkward movements from a mile away if you saw me in real life. I‚Äôm not sure if this would be attributed to inferior Te or not, but I‚Äôm pretty un-assertive and I don‚Äôt like taking the lead for random things just for the sake of taking the lead. It‚Äôs not that I dislike the attention, I just hate asserting myself and trying to act as an authority figure. I wouldn‚Äôt like being above people, I‚Äôd rather be equal and liked than higher and powerful, and plus the added responsibility and pressure is not worth it for me. If it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôm truly passionate about though, I‚Äôm absolutely the first to speak up and let everyone know, whether I not I‚Äôd really ‚Äútake the lead‚Äù that depends, but I definitely show a lot of excitement and enthusiasm if something I‚Äôm passionate about hits. **My main reasons for ESFP:** I feel like I‚Äôm too trusting and enthusiastic about the company of people to be an INFP. I‚Äôve gotten feedback about being very na√Øve and open to strangers even as a child. Canceled social plans just cut so deep for me, I can‚Äôt even explain the overwhelming disappointment when I‚Äôm looking forward to hanging out and then it just gets rescheduled or cancled. I love being with people, especially when they allow me to be who I am and let me show my real self. I love telling stories, making friends, laughing my ass off, and being well known in the community/social life. I feel absolutely furfilled and hyped after a fun social night and I can‚Äôt relate to needing to immediately go home and be alone to recharge. Whole I don‚Äôt mind my alone time, I usually just use it to watch shows or make memes or something, I rarely ever go deep into my thoughts and get extremely depressed if I do. Life is awesome and I think being existential and over-complicated makes things really depressing and weighed down for no reason. I‚Äôve never really seen myself as intuitive, in fact I‚Äôve even gotten feedback for not thinking about future implications, ‚Äúyou need to look at the big picture,‚Äù think about the long-term etc. I sometimes blurt things out without realizing the consequences and doing absolutely retarded things in the moment and then physically cringing at myself as I look back and reflect on it.

1405,1,"I personally think it's mostly a load of bs from a judgemental intuitive lol what are your thoughts?&gt;Extraverted Sensation TypesExtraverted Sensation is the easiest function to understand as it simply coincides with what we observe in the outer reality, usage of the body, force, where objects are located in life and biological factors as well as observation of societal tradition and ancestry.This type's thinking and feeling are mostly guided by the objective reality in general. They are the most ordinary in society and live life by the standardized rules and regulations. Depending on the subtype, one's ethics (Se-Fi) or ideaologies (Se-Ti) may keep them from going overboard as far as hedonism goes.Se dominants with Se subtypes are more hedonistic and have less developed auxiliary functions. (A few rappers belong to this type. Ted Bundy may have also belonged to this type and of course was an extreme case.)Most MBTI blogs don't mention the portion of Se that observes and celebrates ancestral history. However, Jung, Von Franz &amp; Van der Hoop have brought this up. It is also a huge piece of information because it is why Ni dominants are said to at times worship ancestral figures or believe they are in ""spiritual communication"" with archetypes. (Feeling angels watching over them and etc.)Se doms are very much interested in biological facts and scientific research based on dissection of plants, animals and etcSe doms were the majority of western civilization during the time of Jung, Von Franz &amp; Van der Hoop.[ Inferior Ni ] Se types are often good at writing Science Fiction stories or telling ghost stories for fun. The Sci-Fi movies are mostly based in fantasies that manipulate biology because they are aware they are absurd and have no chance of coming true. (As opposed to the Ni dom who is more likely to believe in things such as ghosts &amp; etc.) Paranormal horror films such as The Grudge, Idle Hands, Pet Semetary&amp; Sci-Fi movies such as Jurassic Park, The Fly and Tarantula are great examples of great extraverted sensing creativity in movies. (This isn't to say they are Se types but Se/Ni has been applied.)They are the best at knowing how to use force, aggression and the body to reach their goals. This is why they are often said to be amazing athletes.[ Inferior Ni ] -- During times of stress, they may deviate away from their normal mode of common sense and become paranoid that others are doing things against them[ Inferior Ni ] -- In stress or considering people they dislike, they made attribute inaccurate intuitions about them[ Inferior Ni ] -- May suddenly become interested in eastern philosophy , unconventional spirituality or become interested in basic forms of parapsychology such as the ""daily horoscope"" and such. However, they truly don't understand the concepts of such things and leave that to Ni doms.One of the most efficient and happy-go-lucky types out of them all. They can be happy simply being alive and make the most out of the moment.They may like a neat and aesthetically pleasing house, dress according to the weather and sometimes like to flex material goods.[ Unhealthy Se ] -- They may have an intense ego if they are unhealthy and accumulate tons of money. They become flashy, extravagant, shallow, and egotistical. (Some rappers belong to this type.)[ Unhealthy Se ] -- They may expect special treatment due to status and can be classist. They may set certain standards concerning who's ""allowed"" to be seen with them or not based on morals or ideas surrounding materialism. (The women from the movie Jawbreaker and Mean Girls are included in this type.)Sometimes Se types confuse themselves with feelers because reflexive emotions are sparked with sensations at times and can be intense. ( A woman may get a sudden intense sensation during sex or a man when seeing a woman he is super attracted to.) However, emotional intensity is mostly caused by perceptive functions instead of evaluative ethics.&gt;Life Quote: "" I'd rather pay attention to things I can prove and live each day as if it were my last.

1409,1,"Any personality type is probably capable of cheating under the right circumstances, and ESFPs have a reputation for being the flirtiest type, but I feel like they are relatively unlikely to cheat for a few reasons:1. They would not stay in a relationship that makes them unhappy enough to cheat. They‚Äôre more likely to cut ties first. 2. They don‚Äôt have the patience it would take to try to cover up their infidelity. This would require a lot of strategic maneuvering/planning that they‚Äôre not interested in. 3. Because introverted feeling is such a major part of their being, they wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with the ‚Äúfakery‚Äù that would be infidelity. In other words, they need to be themselves so wholeheartedly that they couldn‚Äôt bring themselves to either stay in an unhappy relationship nor sleep with someone else while being in a relationship. Of course, there‚Äôs the possibility that an ESFP‚Äôs impulsivity wins out, and they do actually sleep with someone but soon after regret it and realize how much they love the partner they‚Äôre with. Has anyone ever been in this situation? Some people need to test boundaries and experience something before they can understand it, and I think ESFPs are definitely that type. Also, what about sleeping with an ex? It seems like introverted feeling would stop them there as well. Obviously, you broke up for a reason, and introverted feeling tends to like emotional closure to a point where you wouldn‚Äôt have any interest in reopening that door.

1419,1,"I have an ESFP who has been grieving the accidental death of a very close family member for over 6 months. She barely goes to work, can't sleep, confesses that she's always irritated at things that would never bother her before, and you can tell when she's thinking of her loved one because she tears up but then refuses to talk about it.

What she did wasn't ill-intended or even bad, but I think she keeps thinking that if only she had done something differently anyhow, it wouldn't have happened. She had a brief period right after the death where she indulged in a lot of drinking and sex. That seems to have abated, but she won't go to therapy or a support group, and she won't go to the doctor and ask for medication.

Se in ESFPs vs ISFPs are described so differently:&gt; Dominant Se is what gives ESFPs that need for sensory experiences. [...] It‚Äôs what would drive them to be the life of the party, as indeed some are.&gt; Auxiliary Function: Se - The next function in the stack is Extroverted Sensing (Se). ISFPs will tend to appear casual and laid back, as most Extroverted Perceivers do.[Source](http://www.practicalmbti.com)I definitely relate more to the open ‚Äúgo-with-the-flow‚Äù whatever approach to life in the ISFP description more than the ‚ÄúI need external stimulation 24/7 and can‚Äôt sit still‚Äù ESFP description.  ‚Ä¢ I do care a lot about my identity (which is why I‚Äôm even into MBTI in the first place haha), and if someone screws one of my values, depending on how important it is for me I‚Äôll stand up for it and stay true to it until the end. If it‚Äôs some piddly thing, I‚Äôm more likely to avoid the conflict because it‚Äôs not worth losing a friendship over, but if they are trying to force me into changing my views I will not budge no matter how much trouble it gets me into.**ESFP:** ‚Ä¢ I do relate to the inferior Ni tendencies like not thinking before I say/do stuff and it affects my social life too. Also feeling like my future is screwed over forever when I‚Äôm under stress and I noticed that I feel like it‚Äôs going to go in one specific path and then end up hopeless in the end. ‚Ä¢ I definitely love social gatherings and chances to hang out with people. I do have social anxiety in certain situations but I tend to do better with people who are older than me.

Many other things.""&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I have studied the functions and thought I was ENFP but now reading about ESFP and the differences between ENFP and ESFP I don't know! :O I seem to possess strong parts of both.

And as for Si or Ne I'm not sure I fully understand them to be honest.&amp;#x200B;Ne:&amp;#x200B;I have a basically unlimited imagination. I saw a test once where you had to name 5 or 10 other things you can use a fork for (or a spoon, can't remember). I can name 10 easily. I can name 50, 100.&amp;#x200B;I can think of something random like Godzilla waltzing through a city with a mop, sweeping all the people into the sea, but knowing in the prophecy this would happen dolphins built an underwater shopping mall that he people can shop and walk around in while they wait for Godzilla to die of exhaustion. Then they will rebuild their city in his bones and remember him with a traditional ceremonial needlepoint contest.&amp;#x200B;I can think of a solution to any problem, 10 solutions, more.&amp;#x200B;I love to read fantasy books. Regular literary books set in the ""real world"" seem boring to me.&amp;#x200B;I am always looking for new ways to do things. It sometimes is about efficiency which is very important to me because of Te but I can actually think of so many ways things can be improved or made faster, more efficient, streamlined, etc.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Se:&amp;#x200B;All my sense are extremely keen. I'm a visual learner and I see something I can understand it instantly, as opposed to trying to read about it. I can always notice details and things no one else can, for example I always see hidden animals that no one even noticed. My ears are very sensitive to any noise and I can't sleep unless I have a fan going to block out any noise that might occur. I am a supertaster and find many things way too bitter to eat, like most vegetables and coffee, etc.&amp;#x200B;I also have always been naturally extremely gifted at any artistic endeavor. I have always been able to draw very well even as a kid and was always the kid everyone wanted to draw pictures for them. I can paint well, sculpt well, do any kind of art well without training. I can see extreme details in art and when creating art.&amp;#x200B;As you can see I am also very interested in performing arts, acting, singing, comedy, dancing, improv, etc.I also don't like philosophical conversations like ""why are we here? ""What is the meaning of happiness?"" ""What is good and evil?"" Something I've been known to say is that philosophy is just mental masturbation. It goes nowhere and has no point. It's asking questions with no answers, just opinions.&amp;#x200B;When I'm reading and see a description I can picture it very well, extremely detailed. If someone says something like ""chandelier"" I can picture the chandelier in extremely detail down to the decorative metal designs. I can picture the ceiling, the windows covered in velvet drapes, the color of them the texture. I can see the whole room and all the details.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;As far as focusing on the future and possibilities or the present I don't know. I don't know what I'll be doing in 5 years, 2, or even tomorrow and I like that but I still dream and imagine future careers and scenarios. I do sometimes talk about different ways the world is changing and will change in the near future.

1449,1,"I‚Äôm in a relationship with an ESFP, and it has been great so far (for a year and a half), up until a few months ago. I took a new job several months after we started dating, and I told her I would only take the job if she moved with me. It wasn‚Äôt a dream job, but it was a small step up. The move was hard on both of us. I hated the job when I first started, she was unemployed for 3 months, and when she got a job she hated it. Yet she wouldn‚Äôt quit. We don‚Äôt have any friends in the new place, and it‚Äôs a small town, so it‚Äôs been difficult for us to meet people. 5-6 months after the move I noticed some changes in her personality. She was no longer bubbly and enthusiastic. When we first got here and I realized I did not like the job, she was a huge support for me and said I should give it a chance, find the best in it, etc. However, when I noticed her becoming somewhat depressed, she wouldn‚Äôt listen to the same advice she gave me. And she refused to quit her job because she didn‚Äôt want to seem like a job hopper. I also suggested that she see a therapist, but she said it wasn‚Äôt that bad and she didn‚Äôt need it. She finally resigned from her job but then has gone home for a little while to ‚Äúget help‚Äù and have some ‚Äútime and space.‚Äù I‚Äôm just so confused over her reasoning for doing this the way she did. As I see it, our situation here is very simple: she hated her job, and we have no friends here. That‚Äôs a very dark place for an ESFP to be. Why didn‚Äôt she take my suggestions to quit sooner and look for other jobs? I‚Äôve asked her if she wants to break up, and she says no, but at the same time she won‚Äôt let me help her.

It said that Nothing Ever Happened, so don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs all like a dream. Everything is ecstasy, inside. We just don‚Äôt know it because of our thinking-minds. But in our true blissful essence of mind is known that everything is alright forever and forever and forever. Close your eyes, let your hands and nerve-ends drop, stop breathing for 3 seconds, listen to the silence inside the illusion of the world, and you will remember the lesson you forgot, which was taught in immense milky way soft cloud innumerable worlds long ago and not even at all. It is all one vast awakened thing. I call it the golden eternity. It is perfect.   &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;We were never really born, we will never really die. It has nothing to do with the imaginary idea of a personal self, other selves, many selves everywhere: Self is only an idea, a mortal idea. That which passes into everything is one thing. It‚Äôs a dream already ended. There‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of and nothing to be glad about. I know this from staring at mountains months on end. They never show any expression, they are like empty space. Do you think the emptiness of space will ever crumble away? Mountains will crumble, but the emptiness of space, which is the one universal essence of mind, the vast awakenerhood, empty and awake, will never crumble away because it was never born. The world you see is just a movie in your mind. Rocks don‚Äôt see it. Bless and sit down. Forgive and forget.   &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;*Practice kindness all day to everybody and you will realize you‚Äôre already in heaven now.* That‚Äôs the story. That‚Äôs the message. Nobody understands it, nobody listens, they‚Äôre all running around like chickens with heads cut off.

1462,1,"Haven't found a lot of pages talking about this, so I figured it was high time for me to make one.  So, recently reevaluating myself after coming off of my SSRIs, I realized the reason I started taking them in the first place; my true and utter hatred of Extraverted Intuition.  Now, while I think Ne CAN be useful, and don't think it is a function that should be wiped off the face of the planet, I find myself shockingly antagonistic whenever I'm having to deal with it. For instance, when I'm hungry, I HATE it when 15-20 minutes are spent talking about ALL the possible places to eat in the area instead of just picking something that sounds tasty and then going; in other words, when Extraverted Intuition is unregulated by any judging function and allowed to run amok.  Being an action/fantasy/sci-fi writer, I have been extremely envious of those capable of using Ne to generate fresh, new ideas (rather than doing what I do and recycling old ideas and then changing details so that they seem fresh). When I actively TRY to use Extraverted Intuition to generate a 'new idea', it often comes across as half-baked. However, whenever I go through being moody and insecure, my brain just naturally sets off on an unanchored journey through intuition-land; when this happens, I entirely disassociate and start to exhibit symptoms of Borderline personality disorder, jumping to conclusions, panicking, suddenly feeling like my identity and sense of self is being threatened by all the possibilities, what I COULD be.   In one online source (forgot the link; sorry!), I read that Demonic Ne in ESxPs tends to manifest as ""confusing possibilities for realities"" or ""jumping to conclusions"". Many, MANY people over the years have accused me of ""jumping to conclusions"", and I myself in recent years have noticed I have a tendency to confuse people's ""might be"" with ""is/will be"", because with sensing there is often an ""is"" and an ""isn't"", and so I don't operate well on ambiguity.

1482,1,"Hi, I'm an ISTP currently in a relationship with an ESFP 17 years old girl. We've been in it for about 6 months now. And I think ive lost her respect. Idk how to explain it. She's always loved me. Up until about 10 days ago. Then her love just sort of faded away. She still says she loves me. And we've had our fair share of bad experiences that we've gone through that helped made us fall more in love with each other. She's said things like how she can never stop loving me no matter what. Not once, not twice, but many times and over a long period of time. I could never doubt her love for me. She's absolutely beautiful. She cared for me, showed it, and always helped me, and was there to make me happy. But something happened about 10 days ago. I approached her and she was irritated with my behavior. She said she found it annoying. I felt really bad. Like how could I ever make someone so lovely feel like that. And I didn't understand it either. And then later, she apologized for her behavior and said she just wasn't feeling well. On that same day, I'd approached her asking about how she was doing and if anything had happened. She didn't say anything. She said, she was alright. Even though she clearly wasn't. I'd spent more time with her than usual on that day because I was leaving for a vacation. And later, when she apologized, she told me that she hated that attitude of hers, the attitude that made her lie, and she felt really bad that she'd made me worried. After that day, I went on a vacation with my family. And since then, in texts, she has stopped giving me her attention and affection like she used to. She still says she loves me and misses me but her actions don't match her words.My best guess as to what's up is that, she's losing her respect n trust for me and she still has love for me but doesn't want to hurt me. And we don't text each other as often as we used to because she just doesn't respond much. She won't talk about it either. She really won't talk about anything. She only responds to what I talk about. Or what I need her for. I don't know how I can help this problem. I've tried not texting her and paying much attention to her n doing my own thing. I've tried telling her how much I do love her and showering her with my attention. I've tried asking her about how's she doing. It all ends into nothing. I'm not afraid of losing her. Because I know I won't. But I just don't understand it. Did I hurt her when I told her that I'd felt bad that I annoyed her? She said she never wanted me to feel sad or bad or anything in this relationship. And that she wasn't good for me. I told her it didn't matter if she felt that way, because I'd fallen in love with her n I didn't care if she thought she wasn't good for me. I would keep being there for her. I said all this. But it only pushed her further away from me. That's how I feel.

1497,1,"#**MBTI**I‚Äôm very sure about being ESFP. I relate to most of the descriptions, I made a couple of type me posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8dxs0c/yet_another_type_me_post/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8hy2xz/type_me_questionnaire/) and got ESFP pretty consistently. I also feel like I line up with the esfp functions (mostly). I know for sure I have fi and inferior ni and the Se description doesn‚Äôt sound too off (apart from being physically graceful lmao). I considered ENFP and ISFJ at one point during this confusing mess but they don‚Äôt match nearly as much as ESFP does. Here are some Mbti ESFP descriptions that resonate with me: &gt; ESFP is definitely a spontaneous, optimistic individual. They love to have fun. If the ESFP has not developed their Thinking side by giving consideration to rational thought processing, they tend to become over-indulgent, and place more importance on immediate sensation and gratification than on their duties and obligations. They may also avoid looking at long-term consequences of their actions.&gt; The ESFP is a great team player. He or she is not likely to create any problems or fuss, and is likely to create the most fun environment possible for getting the task done.&gt; Utterly social, ESFPs enjoy the simplest things, and there‚Äôs no greater joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends.&gt; There‚Äôs nothing that makes ESFPs feel quite as unhappy as realizing that they are boxed in by circumstance, unable to join their friends.&gt; ESFPs sometimes ignore and avoid conflict entirely. They tend to say and do what‚Äôs needed to get out of such situations, then move on to something more fun.&gt; #**Authority and social status are secondary to feeling like they‚Äôre an important part of a team that gets the job done.**&gt; Sounds like a great idea! They don‚Äôt even care where they are going, as long as they get to hang out with friends and have a good time.&gt; ESFPs hold values of sympathy, tactfulness and care toward their peers. ESFPs can appear casual, flexible and easy-going, but when they feel something or someone they value has been slighted, they will stand firm and stubborn.&gt; Se-doms can be emotionally triggered in a variety of ways, such as: being judged as immature or superficial or incompetent, feeling that others doubt the legitimacy of their talents or achievements, not receiving positive feedback for their work, being criticized when they have put out a lot of effort, spending too much time with overly serious or impractical people, working with inflexible/cynical/uncooperative/incompetent people, being pressured to make long term commitments, being pressured into making decisions that can have a major impact on future developments, feeling as though alternatives or options are being closed off, being forced to work in excessively structured environments, enduring rigid routines or procedural work for long periods, feeling pressured to conform to other people‚Äôs rules or schedules, tight deadlines or onerous supervision, feeling a lack of stimulation or variety, feeling disorganized or mentally clouded, feeling unable to solve problems quickly and efficiently, being overwhelmed by too many duties or a heavy workload.#**SOCIONICS**Now that I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not mistyped in mbti, I went on to read some of the socionics descriptions and see what it had to say about ESFPs. I found a whole ton of crap like &gt; SEE ‚Äì ESFp ‚Äì Napoleon (Leader)&gt; The SEE is characterized by the drive to expand his influence, by the desire of authority and glory. In order to realize these goals it is necessary to learn how to control people, by manipulating their weaknesses and avoiding their strengths so as to never be conquered.&gt;  Se doms tend to use the physical aspect of power to sway others. This includes but is not limited to intimidation, gaslighting, persistence, among others. Some dial up the charm, knowing that a lot of ppl respond to easy going ppl sometimes more drastically than the intimidation route. These are the aw shucks types that seem to always be down to do things with others, hoping their charm will convince others to comply.&gt; ""I - the most powerful man in the world, rookie."" &gt; It is very self-confident in their own abilities, he believes that can do everything. Often the impression voluntarist: I think it's right, then it should be good for everyone. It produces an impression of a strong man, he seemed to always have enough space around, ""like a bull in a china shop."" If he is physically strong, that despises ""wimps"", if the opposite is weak, then all athletes - ""redneck"". Often good handle money, but these issues are either too conservative or too cocky. Life is perceived through the prism of power ""who is who"". In order to be heard by them, you need to force yourself to respect in any way. Any weakness of man perceived as a disadvantage, so often they can use it, not seeing anything wrong. Always do something, developing skills. Usually, their strength is visible to the naked eye, but it lacks flexibility, rather it is something monumental and conservative. Always try to be just the first in any case, if this does not work, something very angry. If their strength and ability to question, it should also be a flash of aggression. Potentially - excellent athletes, but a constant re-evaluation of their own forces is fraught with injuries. Preaches the cult of power and skill, confident in their external data. It asserts its exclusivity, uniqueness. He does not consider it necessary to get someone on the approval of this or that act, and the decision is made ‚Äã‚Äãby a very arrogant. Do not hesitate to use force anywhere. Angry, annoyed, if someone it ""contradict"" and is externally visible. &gt; SEE - this is a strong, domineering personality. A girl of seven years creating a lot of problems to parents: she fights with anyone who contradicts her in something. And most importantly, that she wins even in a fight with the boys.&gt; Even he likes to control people, or rather, it is in the blood. The chief-SEE everything must be subordinated.&gt; The individual feels at home among people who are actively doing something and interacting with each other directly (visibly), and is able to organize people, move them around as necessary, and guide them in achieving a specific goal. He or she likes obedience and even subservience in others, since it allows him to ""make things happen"" more effectively.#Geez, what happened?!??I know if you‚Äôre on r/mbti you‚Äôve probably gotten sick and tired of me obsessing over this stuff.

1505,1,"ESFP's have been a reoccurring love interests in my life.&amp;nbsp;I've been in love with this one ESFP since the very start of High School, at the beginning I thought she wouldn't even notice me, but for some strange reason we actually got pretty flipping close. Hugging, Pecking each other on the face every chance we get etc. etc. But I've always been conflicted about if I should make the move. The main reason is that I LOVE that caring, loving, compassionate side of here, where we just do nothing but hold each other, but I always feared that I would let her down if we were to get into a relationship. She loves to go out to parties every single weekend, and I absolutely HATE such crowded places. It's the biggest part of her social life and I just feel like that's going to be a big disconnect. Heck we even went out on 2 dates, to which SHE asked ME to, and I probably wasn't ever going to do it because of me being so conflicted. She's told everyone about me, like I used to be a pretty unknown figure around town, but she's talked to everyone about me I feel like 70% of the city that's our age knows about me now. She used to say that she loves how unique I am, how I have my own opinions and don't change them for anyone, how I'm not a person you meet everyday, how I have my own beliefs and values etc. And she used SOOO MANY signs that she likes me and wants to be with me, and she probably thinks I didn't notice any of them, but Oh I did, I noticed every single one of her body language signs I'm just a flarking idiot for not doing ANYTHING about it.&amp;nbsp;And now, I've lost her... And I don't blame her, she got tired of waiting on me she just got into a new relationship. And I convinced myself for a very large portion of time since then that I didn't care. Because the previous ""crushes"" I had that got into relationships always ended with me having big emotional outbursts, and I didn't have any when she got into a relationship. I just said to myself that we weren't for each other anyway because of how Extroverted she is, and because of how much I don't show emotion and just hold it all inside.&amp;nbsp;And with having her out of the picture I started noticing that I still have crushes that are ALL YOU! ESFPS! MY CURSE! I'm Cursed with loving creatuers that I can't have. I discovered this other girl that's a year younger than me that actually SAID that she likes me just from how I look and brief moments of her overhearing my conversations. But I sure as hell ain't gonna do nothing about it BECAUSE I'M A FLARKING INTROVERT THAT DOESN'T OPEN UP TO ANYBODY!!! (I'm not that introverted, I'm actually pretty talkative and whenever I take the online tests I usually get a good 54 to 46 percent Introversion to Extroversion, it's just that it doesn't matter how talkative and fun I am, I just don't show my inner emotions towards people and it's holding me back). And even tho this new girl is pretty cute and I'd really like to be with her, I still feel like the previous one is a 100% the perfect match for me. Sure she has a pretty extroverted social side but that's just 1 disconnect between us, we have so much in common, and we got sooo close to the point that we spent whole days close to each other.&amp;nbsp;But, maybe there's another option. Maybe I didn't actually love her truly, I think I just enjoyed having that closeness to someone. I've never been in a true relationship, and If anything I'd say that this relationship is the closest thing I had to an actual relationship because of that physical connection. She started the hugging and the kissing and I just enjoyed it to it's fullest. I don't know if I'll ever get to do that again. That's stopped now, we've stopped talking as much and the most physical connection we have is a quick hug... And I think that's what I miss the most.&amp;nbsp;Ok, I finished venting and ranting. I needed an outlet to just get it all out of me. I really, REALLY hope she doesn't get out of that relationship because I know as soon as she does she's gonna get close to me again and I'm gonna be destroyed. At least now I don't feel as strong emotions as I did when she was single, and if she gets single again we are a 100% gonna start hugging and kissing again and I  don't know if I can take it. I just know I'm not gonna do anything about it again and if I do it's going to be disappointing. If she does do that again I think the smartest option for me to do is to just say that she needs to stop being so physically close to me, that way there's some distance between us and I can fully get over her. &amp;nbsp;Seriously tho, you people need to tone down your attractive personalities, both the emotional and outgoing sides. My heart can't take it.","INFP here, can you stooooppp being so attractive?",s have been a reoccurring love interest in my life amp nbsp i ve been in love with this one since the very start of high school at the beginning i thought she wouldn t even notice me but for some strange reason we actually got pretty flipping close hugging pecking each other on the face every chance we get etc etc but i ve always been conflicted about if i should make the move the main reason is that i love that caring loving compassionate side of here where we just do nothing but hold each other but i always feared that i would let her down if we were to get into a relationship she love to go out to party every single weekend and i absolutely hate such crowded place it s the biggest part of her social life and i just feel like that s going to be a big disconnect heck we even went out on 2 date to which she asked me to and i probably wasn t ever going to do it because of me being so conflicted she s told everyone about me like i used to be a pretty unknown figure around town but she s talked to everyone about me i feel like 70 of the city that s our age know about me now she used to say that she love how unique i am how i have my own opinion and don t change them for anyone how i m not a person you meet everyday how i have my own belief and value etc and she used sooo many sign that she like me and want to be with me and she probably think i didn t notice any of them but oh i did i noticed every single one of her body language sign i m just a flarking idiot for not doing anything about it amp nbsp and now i ve lost her and i don t blame her she got tired of waiting on me she just got into a new relationship and i convinced myself for a very large portion of time since then that i didn t care because the previous crush i had that got into relationship always ended with me having big emotional outburst and i didn t have any when she got into a relationship i just said to myself that we weren t for each other anyway because of how extroverted she is and because of how much i don t show emotion and just hold it all inside amp nbsp and with having her out of the picture i started noticing that i still have crush that are all you s my curse i m cursed with loving creatuers that i can t have i discovered this other girl that s a year younger than me that actually said that she like me just from how i look and brief moment of her overhearing my conversation but i sure a hell ain t gonna do nothing about it because i m a flarking introvert that doesn t open up to anybody i m not that i m actually pretty talkative and whenever i take the online test i usually get a good 54 to 46 percent introversion to extroversion it s just that it doesn t matter how talkative and fun i am i just don t show my inner emotion towards people and it s holding me back and even tho this new girl is pretty cute and i d really like to be with her i still feel like the previous one is a 100 the perfect match for me sure she ha a pretty extroverted social side but that s just 1 disconnect between u we have so much in common and we got sooo close to the point that we spent whole day close to each other amp nbsp but maybe there s another option maybe i didn t actually love her truly i think i just enjoyed having that closeness to someone i ve never been in a true relationship and if anything i d say that this relationship is the closest thing i had to an actual relationship because of that physical connection she started the hugging and the kissing and i just enjoyed it to it s fullest i don t know if i ll ever get to do that again that s stopped now we ve stopped talking a much and the most physical connection we have is a quick hug and i think that s what i miss the most amp nbsp ok i finished venting and ranting i needed an outlet to just get it all out of me i really really hope she doesn t get out of that relationship because i know a soon a she doe she s gonna get close to me again and i m gonna be destroyed at least now i don t feel a strong emotion a i did when she wa single and if she get single again we are a 100 gonna start hugging and kissing again and i don t know if i can take it i just know i m not gonna do anything about it again and if i do it s going to be disappointing if she doe do that again i think the smartest option for me to do is to just say that she need to stop being so physically close to me that way there s some distance between u and i can fully get over her amp nbsp seriously tho you people need to tone down your attractive personality both the emotional and outgoing side my heart can t take it infp here can you stooooppp being so attractive,4621,969,0.052,0.188,0.76,0.9995

tend to order the same thing because i‚Äôm comfortable with it but if someone suggusts something to me unless there‚Äôs a really good reason not to get it i‚Äôll try it when i visit someone‚Äôs house and it‚Äôs cluttered and messy i actually admire it it come across to me a they‚Äôre living their life to the fullest instead of gushing over how everything is displayed a long a you know where

I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ESFP) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance!

With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)##[You can take the Big 5 test here](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)(it's free, the $29 ""cost"" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click ""no thanks"")**Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.**Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.-----[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)&gt; * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven‚Äîsometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.&gt;* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.&gt;* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.&gt;* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.&gt;* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):&gt;The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.",Big 5 Correlations (x-post fro r/INFJ),hey there s i m a mod over on r infj and we ve been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any big 5 correlation between type so far i ve got input from infjs s intps and entps mostly i ve asked a few other type a well and now i m coming to you i promise to come back with result if i get enough people to participate just state your type it s ok if you re not an and your score for each big 5 category and feel free to add anything else from your result if you want to share thanks in advance see below for more info there is a lot of talk regarding v the big 5,570,127,0.0,0.12,0.88,0.9231

1526,1,"I have a good friend who is an ESFP. Before I get into my problem with her, I'll say this. She's kind, she's thoughtful, she's hilarious, she's wonderful as a person and I value her friendship deeply. Our friendship means a lot. She's genuinely special to me and I'm only asking the following questions in order to preserve our friendship. So. My problem. I work with her. At the moment, I work a little above her. She is on a team I am responsible for. And, though I love her in informal friendship settings, she is incredibly immature and unprofessional in situations that require professionalism. We're meeting with investors at the moment, as we need funding for this project. She is manic, bordering on panicked in these meetings. It's genuinely embarrassing to be in a meeting with professionals with her- she stresses out in front of them, scrambles for the answers to questions, has no sense of order when presenting our case, scatters notes across the table, interrupts me frequently, despite me being midway through a presentation. I am also struggling with being technically 'in charge' of her. She is really quite unreliable- she struggles to meet deadlines, and if I ask her for something more than once she takes it personally. If I ask a question to understand what she meant by something in her notes, she takes it personally. She has a specific expression and tone that I know well; it means her feelings are hurt and I may well hear about it later. If I take a moment with someone else on the team, she asks me later why she wasn't included- well, because it wasn't your area and had nothing to do with what you're working on. I love her, I care about her, but I'm getting very frustrated with her. How do I gently ask her to be professional at work? And how can I help her stop feeling like she has to... I don't know, fix things with me? She's also getting to a point where she can absolutely sense my frustration and as a result is trying extra hard. I really don't like it when she tries so hard, I like it when she's just herself- but lately she's been forcing humour, trying to be funny rather than letting it come naturally as it usually does to her, messaging me twice as much as usual, asking me if we're okay almost every day, and it's driving me a little insane. I just want her to be a little more professional at work and know where the line is. I don't want to hurt her feelings, but she seems to be so easily offended at times. It's getting to the point where I'm starting to get irritated with her in non-work settings just because her behaviour is reminding me of what she's doing at work. I'm sorry if this sounds judgemental, I really do care about her, but I'm getting so exhausted with balancing her and work.

1534,1,"as there are a lot of silly stereotypes and weird typing-questions, im a bit confused because i tested as many types before, enfj, enfp, isfp, infj and well, now as esfp, which feels more right than the others.maybe you are able to help me being sure ( hope it won't be getting too long).most questions are somehow misleading, i have a perfect memory, live in the now but am also pretty much intuitive about certain things.but let's start at the beginning, some relevant memories:as a child ive been adventurous and curious,jumped headfirst into our pond because i wanted to see the fish in their environment instead of looking at them from a distance, that i couldn't yet swim being 2 didn't matter to me.sometimes being a bit impertinent and reckless, loved doing parodies if i felt that something was ridiculous (which very angered my teacher in elementary school because I even did them during class).actually fought with the boys in my class in breaks instead of just enjoying being chased around by them as opposed to all the other girls just giggling and be girly like. in return they let me play football ( soccer) with them as the only girl in both teams.protected a boy in my class no-one liked, they threw his clothes into the girls changing room after swimming class and i was the only one being appalled by such behaviour, took them, marched over to him, gave them back and yelled at these idiots for being insensitive idiots. that's been also the first time when i thought that the others all just were a bunch of hypocritical asses, because even those who judged my parodies negatively because you just don't do that( norms, weird perceptions of what's allowed to do and no go's in society, *sigh) laughed their asses off at the expense of this lonely, shy boy.even though i was a very active and demanding child, i needed alone time and the quiet, spending it with drawing or playing nintendo games.at the age of 3 my parents decided that i should learn to dance, maybe because i was too active? don't know for sure.so i wound up dancing competitively solo for 18 years, but despite training 2 to 3 hours per day, i took riding lessons, played football with the boys, in my teens i even jogged 15 km AFTER my daily dance training of 3 to 4 hours then.sounds insane and it was.then at the age of 10 something happened that turned my world and myself upside down.had high fever for about 2 weeks, nearly died, had visions of angels and such like.so after that, i was diagnosed with hashimotos syndrome, which blessed me with severe brain fog, anxiety, not being able to concentrate for long, a depressed state of mind/feeling and and and.additionally my father chose to be an alcoholic and made my teenage life more miserable by shouting at me, telling me that i would never accomplish anything besides many other niceties.only now, nearly 32, i found a way to selfmedicate and lift the brain fog, being depressed, the anxiety.after years of no contact my father stopped drinking a few years ago.im finding my way more and more back to my true self, but for me it's not going back but forward.sorry that it's gotten so long, im a bit feely right now and had to get it off my chest.so what do you think?

1538,1,"Hi! Female INTP here.I‚Äôm in need of advice. I‚Äôve been working closely with an ESFP for more than 15 years. Of everyone on our team, she‚Äôs the one who I‚Äôve never been able to click with. It makes me sad because I admire her and hate feeling tension around other people.We‚Äôre a similar age, and met in our mid teens (both early 30s now). All I want is to understand how to interact with her. But it seems like every time I see her she shows a new face. Some weeks she‚Äôll seem eager to talk and be friends, other times I feel like I‚Äôm being bullied and ignored in favour of the cool kids. Some weeks she‚Äôll be aggressively show-offy; other weeks I can tell her walls have lowered and she wants emotional support or connection.I am sure that she‚Äôs deeply sensitive. She had issues with her weight and looks growing up which she‚Äôs overcome but still seem triggering to her. She can get really angry at work superiors, but it‚Äôs usually when she feels an injustice. It hurts me to witness that, because it seems like she ignores other people‚Äôs feelings and just assumes the worst in their motivations. I wonder if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening between her and me.This sounds cocky, but I do wonder sometimes if part of our issue is that she‚Äôs jealous. If she feels like we‚Äôre getting too equal, it‚Äôs like she has to lash out and destroy the equilibrium again.In the past she‚Äôs been nicest to me when I‚Äôve expressed genuine admiration of her. But she seems to have an internal idea of exactly how much praise she requires, because too much or too little and she‚Äôs back to being mistrusting of me.Do any of you identify with this?

1594,1,"I've been seeing my esfp girlfriend for about 2.5 months now. We met through a friend and hit it off right away. We live around 30mins away from each other. I'm a student while she's a flight attendant. For those of you who aren't aware, flight attendants have insanely tough work schedules which can wreck havoc on your sleep and health; plus the physically intensive work and long work hours can be stressful. But she loves her job and seems to have abundant energy always.The 1st month was great. We'd meet around twice a week (which works out great for both of us considering she gets only 1 day off a week and me being ISTP) and had terrific chemistry. We have similar values and I even had an awesome time with her friends.The next month was terrible for her. Her work schedule was crazy hectic, she lost her credit card and had to shift to a new place. As I was busy with classes during the day and the only free time she had was spent by her running from place to place to sort things out, we had absolutely no way of seeing each other. She had night shifts, day shifts all over the place and things were chaotic. I tried to supportive throughout asking if she needed any help with things. My texts and calls would often go unanswered, and I had no way of knowing how she was doing. She'd get back to me at times and tell me about how exhausted she was and that she'd see me soon but well, I haven't seen her in a month now. Due to the crazy communication breakdown happening (no texts and calls from her side; I'd initiate contact always now, and she'd respond very rarely), I was losing my patience and said I needed a break from things if communication was going to be one sided like this. I wanted to be there for her and help her out but she just seemed to shut me out completely from her life. She got back to me once saying she wasn't ignoring me but it was because of work and her issues that she hasn't been able to talk. I still can't understand how that's an excuse to not be able to drop a one-line text reply a day. There have been days when she wouldn't take calls at all and just disappear from the face of the earth only to get back to me 2 days later. The last text I sent her, she didn't respond at all for 4 days. I just left her a text afterwards saying that she didn't have to do everything alone and that I was here for her to open up to. I just reassured her that I cared for her and she just needed to reach out. I haven't heard from her in 2 weeks now.I've done every bit to try and be supportive but she just seems not want any of it. I don't know if she's in an Ni grip kinda situation or if she's ghosting me, but I've decided to fade out of this. If she reaches out to me, we can talk this through. Otherwise I'm done.Do ESFPs always shut down like this under stress? Is it because of aux Fi? My friend through whom I met her says she has always tried to project an image where she wants everyone to think she's got all under control even when there's a crisis inside of her.

I don't belong here, but I seriously need help so whoop here I is. I've known an ESFP for 3 years now and I adore her more than I've ever loved anyone. She's nothing like the narcissistic, elusive, party-clown stereotype you'd read about on a tumblr description. We were always drawn to each other but were basically strangers. Then over a month ago she broke down crying in an emotional moment and I was the one that held her. I'm still the one that holds her. We've texted every single day since then and haven't broken the streak, plus we volunteer at the same facility so I see her up to three times a week. In the beginning it was quite like the rush of burying deeper in depth, holding your breath in anticipation of what's under the waves. She would text me the second she'd wake up and we'd talk and laugh until she fell asleep. She'd visit me at work and I'd bring her gifts to her work. We clicked on all the things we had in common and were amazed by our differences. She laughed at mah sick memes, would constantly say she loved me. Now it's just not the same. She still texts me when she wakes up everyday but the conversation fizzles long before the afternoon, and I'm usually the one trying to chase the spark. She doesn't visit me anymore, or care what I think about things, doesn't laugh at my jokes as much, rarely says I love you. I feel annoying and worthless, I fear I'm losing her. In person, the last time I saw her I held her as she cried again, but that doesn't mean we really click when we talk. Mostly we just vibe. I'm very boring when we're not working on something or listening to her play music. I'm two years older, so maybe she sees me as aIf you read this, any advice?

He always told me he doesn't want a relationship, and I've never tried to change his mind on this. But recently, he's been ignoring me a little bit and acting withdrawn, as if our friendship doesn't matter to him, when it's always seemed to matter hugely in the past. He's always been really private, so I know there's no point asking him to explain what's going on. But basically, I don't understand why it is he doesn't want a relationship when we get on so well as friends as well as, y'know, the other stuff. Also, why the brush-off? Am I just too needy?

1622,1,"Ok, so I'm an INFP (I know one of those lol). Anyways, I recently reconnected with some guy who I share a mutual friend with. We hung out in group settings and flirted/talked a couple times a while ago. Then it led to this. So, we've been ""seeing each other"" for around 3 weeks now. Probably hung out around 4 or 5 times. The dates weren't really traditional though, which i get since ESFP's prefer ""doing things."" I'm confused though. We did sleep together the second time, he tried the first date but I didn't want to. I've come to see he's just a really physically affectionate person, and he's said that too. The thing I don't get is what's going on I guess? I know 3 weeks is short and I'm probably overthinking. It's just when we hang out it's so great and it feels like we're so connected. He alludes to doing things with and for me in the future. He seems to genuinely care, but gets kind personal and pushy with questions tbh. But overall I would think he likes me?? But, in between we hardly talk. He would take hours to answer texts, which I think is normal for him. But still. Now, I haven't talked to him for like 5 days. Almost a week. The last time I talked to him he responded quicker which was weird. Anyways, not important. What I want to know is should I just try and be more casual? Do you think it'd be better if I back off and let him chase me more. Or would he take it as a sign I'm not interested. I don't think so but still. I'm just confused and don't want to scare him off. I'm ok with taking things as they are I just don't want to trust him if he's not interested.

1642,1,"So the title says it all. A little while ago this girl who I use to be really close with for over a year maybe two and almost dated that whole time just recently ""found me"". We use to be great friends and whatever else we were until I messed it up and blew her off for some other girl. So over the years I tried to reconnect and it didn't work out she wouldn't have it all, hating me basically. But recently she decided to find me, ended up looking me up and creating profiles on a few social media sites just to find my profile. Now were talking again and she says she has a BF who she says has been just using her for sex and it doesn't look too good for them. They seem to be almost done.Now down to the MBTI part. I've tested every time as an ENFP and  I told her about this recently and she took the test and found out she's an ESFP. We get along amazingly and I haven't really found much a problem yet, communication isn't as difficult as some have said it would be between these two types but I'd like to know if it's just me trying hard to make it work, and if there is anything else I can do? I read that ESFPs like for their feelings to be validated and since then I've made sure I've told her feelings are right and should be expressed. I also learned that Intuitive conversations might get a little stale but it hasn't been a problem so far with her, she seems to listen really well and find my intuitive conversation pieces interesting. Like how I talk about medicinal plants alot with a passion, she doesn't seem to mind. So am I doing this right or am I making a mistake? We seem to have alot in common and she is a great person. If I have to I wouldn't mind sacrificing some of my more Ne thoughts but I'd like to know if I'm starting off on the right foot. She even just asked me if I would use her if we ever decided to date again, almost like shes priming me for it. I'm not trying to get too excited though. Also I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket by relying on the MBTI too much, because ""individuals still are"" but it has helped me understand the way some think around me.TL;DR I an ENFP male might date an ESFP female.

He did everything he could have, and I love him very much but I have realized I am just not IN love with him. He was totally shocked and heartbroken by the breakup, so now he wants a detailed explanation of reasons I feel this way, and why I am not in love with him as I once was... but I am too afraid to hurt his feelings and selfesteem... He told me he needed answers for his sanity, so I tried to as lovingly and tactfully as possible explain some of my motives, but he still can't wrap his head around it. Is it best to keep the details of why I want more to myself or will it actually help him to move on  by telling him what was unfulfilling for me? I am so afraid to hurt him more than I already have but I want to help him cope with this as much as possible.

Once the trip ended we kept talking, when we met in the halls and in class since she's in a grade ahead of me we only had one class a week together (this year one class a day) and basicly we stayed in touch and I even heard whispers from some of her closest friends that she liked me.

1707,1,"I'm an INFP and last year I feel deeply in love with an ESFP and I haven't stopped loving him since. In the beginning I took an instant liking to him, which is unusual for me as it takes me a while to warm up to people. But with him I realised he was something quite special and I didn't want to let him go.It was at first quite difficult because I'd never felt this way about someone before and I kept pestering him to see him again and I got really obsessed and I would just end up sending him huge texts about my feelings. It just pushed him further away and so I stopped trying to force things to happen and left him alone. Then half a year later, the opportunity came up for me to meet him again. I decided to change my attitude and try doing things his way, namely, not thinking too much about what things meant and just enjoying the moment. And it worked so well, we became so close to eachother. We worked well together, we would help eachother with our work and we kind of complemented eachother. It was so beautiful and I know that he thought it was too, which felt like quite an accomplishment for me because he always has this strong facade and it felt like an honour to find the sensitive part that was underneath. When he told me I was beautiful it was such a proud moment. Often several weeks would go by between us meeting oneanother but each time we met we would become closer than ever. We were even going to go on a trip to Berlin together.Then it changed suddenly when I told him something that I didn't realise he would get upset about. I won't go into detail about it because I feel guilty enough but the essence of the problem was that I was incredibly naive and he ended up feeling hurt and feeling that he couldn't trust me again.I thought this was the end but after a month of hearing nothing from him he told me he was ready to forgive me because he knew I never meant to hurt him. He said he didn't think he was going to be able to trust me again but that he missed me and thought about me a lot. However, he also said that he thought that we could never be more than friends. I guess he's completely within his rights to say so and I should feel lucky that he even forgave me, let alone want to be friends with me.But the problem is that I love him so much and I want more. And I know that we work well together and so I know I can make him happy. So for the first time since I told him about the hurtful thing, he said he wants to meet me again because he misses me. I don't know what to do because I've never spent time with him simply as friends before. I somehow want to show him when I see him next that I'm worth more than that but I'm not sure how...",How to win an ESFP back,i m an infp and last year i feel deeply in love with an and i haven t stopped loving him since in the beginning i took an instant liking to him which is unusual for me a it take me a while to warm up to people but with him i realised he wa something quite special and i didn t want to let him go it wa at first quite difficult because i d never felt this way about someone before and i kept pestering him to see him again and i got really obsessed and i would just end up sending him huge text about my s it just pushed him further away and so i stopped trying to force thing to happen and left him alone then half a year later the opportunity came up for me to meet him again i decided to change my attitude and try doing thing his way namely not too much about what thing meant and just enjoying the moment and it worked so well we became so close to eachother we worked well together we would help eachother with our work and we kind of complemented eachother it wa so beautiful and i know that he thought it wa too which felt like quite an accomplishment for me because he always ha this strong facade and it felt like an honour to find the sensitive part that wa underneath when he told me i wa beautiful it wa such a proud moment often several week would go by between u meeting oneanother but each time we met we would become closer than ever we were even going to go on a trip to berlin together then it changed suddenly when i told him something that i didn t realise he would get upset about i won t go into detail about it because i feel guilty enough but the essence of the problem wa that i wa incredibly naive and he ended up hurt and that he couldn t trust me again i thought this wa the end but after a month of hearing nothing from him he told me he wa ready to forgive me because he knew i never meant to hurt him he said he didn t think he wa going to be able to trust me again but that he missed me and thought about me a lot however he also said that he thought that we could never be more than friend i guess he s completely within his right to say so and i should feel lucky that he even forgave me let alone want to be friend with me but the problem is that i love him so much and i want more and i know that we work well together and so i know i can make him happy so for the first time since i told him about the hurtful thing he said he want to meet me again because he miss me i don t know what to do because i ve never spent time with him simply a friend before i somehow want to show him when i see him next that i m worth more than that but i m not sure how how to win an back,2607,551,0.071,0.207,0.722,0.9984

1736,1,"Psychic mediumship and telepathy is expressed throughout pop culture. What this means is that other human beings are expressing their observations about reality through art. Art is a powerful medium which can heighten awareness in other individuals very quickly. Artists take their own life experiences and inner realities and display them for the public to see. Awareness of ESP is expressed over and over and over again in the artistic world. It's time to own up to the truth and be real: we are all psychic. Telepathy is real, and it should be used well (with kindness). We are all psychic mediums, and when we believe in ourselves, we can connect with the spirit world directly telepathically. We don't need religions, other psychics, or authority figures to tell us what reality is. We have our own observations, and when we open our minds to new information, more confirming experiences about the truth of reality. There is no death. There is a difference between being extremely confident in our observations and expressing this confidence to other people, and being authoritative. Think for yourself. Question authority.

1741,1,"So for the longest time I thought I was an introverted intuitive. I was painfully shy and awkward in high school and so I spent more time in books and video games. However, recently since I've been in college I started noticing something different about myself. I actually appreciate life more when I'm around other people and that I actually hate reading and analyzing intellectual stuff, it's all rather absurd, but I'd rather just be ""doing stuff"". You know, just stop thinking and just go for it! Working out, eating, going to different parts of town, trying out new clubs. So I was wondering, I was born rather outgoing. I loved to sing, dance, call for attention and act out. I was totally hands on guy and I loved the simple things. I've always been rather quirky and ridiculous, loud-mouthed and boisterous. However, I think I turned shy for a long period of time and I didn't have many friends so for years I thought I was introverted. But you know what, even during those years, I think there were times when I unleashed my inner energy and it felt right!So now I feel like I'm coming home and being more comfortable in being my true MBTI, an ESFP rather than the INFJ I thought that I was. But I'm still not sure whether I'm just imagining all this in my head or I'm trying to emulate ESFP behavior when I'm really INFJ because I do plan ahead A LOT, and I'm constantly thinking about the future and my future plans. But also, I'm happier when I'm just in the flow just doing things. I don't know, what do you guys think?And how can I be more comfortable in who I am and start being outgoing and hands on and really channel my burning energy inside?

I hope I did you justice.)*****ESFP**ESFPs at their best are perceptive individuals who follow their own path.  They are keenly aware of their surroundings and are able to quickly identify and appropriately react to novel stimuli.  They jump on opportunities to participate actively in the world, readily absorbing new experiences and approaching each situation with a receptive attitude.  They do not miss much, either, and will often notice changes or interesting details before others do.  That said, they do not tolerate boredom or tedium well, and will often attempt to find other ways to entertain themselves.  Their primary interest is in seeking out all that life has to offer, and exploring a multitude of adventures in search of mindfulness and self-expression.ESFPs believe that they will be best able to find harmony in their lives if they stay true to their desires and beliefs and react authentically and honestly to the positions they find themselves in. They will not accept the fact that a particular behavior is ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòimportant‚Äô just because others tell them that it is so, but rather, they do what feels right to them in the moment, searching for evidence to justify and verify their natural inclinations. In this way, they can develop a pattern of morality and personal belief that is independent from that of their peer group or society at large.  They are skilled at perceiving and reacting to the true nature of the scenario at hand and not simply doing what is expected of them. It is important, however, for ESFPs to reflect on the objective facts and information they can obtain from society when they make decisions or interpretations, as the way they personally feel about a situation does not always paint the full picture. ESFPs who allow themselves to explore objective data without making personal value judgments too quickly will discover, with pleasure, that doing so refines their ability to accurately interpret present circumstances and allows them to develop a quicker and more authentic reaction to the experiences they undergo.A young or immature ESFP will not attempt to evaluate the consequences of their actions before they commit to them, and will often find that their efforts did not turn out as they had anticipated.  They also may be skeptical of claims that people, the natural world, or events can be accurately theorized about, interpreted, or predicted.  They will resist attempts to analyze or define themselves, which can leave them vulnerable to the whims of shifting external circumstance.However, as the ESFP grows and matures, they will begin to find a balance between being immersed in the events of the present moment and developing global theories in order to understand the implications of those events.  They will become more skilled at anticipating the consequences of their actions, making decisions based on not only what is seen and interpreted in the moment, but also taking into consideration that which is unseen and unknown.  They will find themselves becoming more skilled at noticing patterns and developing an intuition about people and occurrences, using all of the present evidence they so keenly perceive to check and verify these hunches, and in doing so will further develop their ability to react appropriately to novel conditions.  That said, ESFPs will always be more flexible and observant than most other types, quick to respond and jump into interesting and exciting ventures, and rarely allowing their beliefs or expectations to cloud their awareness of what is really going on.Mature ESFPs are often very good at seeing things from other people‚Äôs perspectives and sensing how they are feeling or responding to the circumstances at hand, but they often do not find much pleasure or gratification in engaging with this ability unless it‚Äôs in service of some larger goal or in order to help someone they care about.  Because they are so focused on drinking in every facet of their present situation, they resist the task of noticing patterns and forming conclusions based on how things have worked out in the past for them.  However, when they are sufficiently motivated, they are very skilled at doing so, and those who allow themselves to practice this skill will discover it to be very useful when they find themselves stuck in a rut or seeking guidance for an important decision.ESFPs do not enjoy evaluating facts and arguments for internal consistency and are prone to making careless errors in reasoning.  They will often prefer to delegate this task to someone they trust to do it better.  That said, they are capable of doing it - begrudgingly - when no help is available.  ESFPs find it very difficult to conceive of every available outcome, idea, or possibility that could spring from the present moment in time, and cannot help but believe that things ‚Äúare what they are‚Äù and have the internal sense that the world is unlikely to change much.  They also have relatively modest expectations for the results of their decisions and generally do not feel that individual choices are of dire importance.  Although they may, with much determination, be capable of success in leading and directing grand, ambitious projects, it is not where they thrive.  They prefer to explore the world actively and spontaneously, reacting in the moment, doing what seems right, and letting the chips fall where they may.To summarize, ESFPs are perceptive and genuine individuals who seek to discover as much as they can about the world around them and themselves.  They do so by actively participating in as many experiences as possible and by being true to themselves and their own beliefs.  When they balance these capabilities and desires with an eye on objective facts as well as their internal sense of what seems likely to happen and be meaningful, they can make astounding discoveries and impressions in the world, leading others to open their eyes to a new sensation of awareness and realizations that they had never grasped before.",My type description of ESFPs!,hi guy i ve been

It's difficult for me to speak about these things and connect with ANYONE on an emotional level. It's been difficult for me to deal with all of this, and I've been trying to overcome my pessimism and withdrawn emotions.The ESFP I am dating seems to get discouraged whenever I am withdrawn from him.

1792,1,"Hey guys, it's been a long journey for me. Making it short I'm an ESFP who experienced a trauma right before entering my teens which caused me to retreat from the world and live in denial about a lot of things for 5 years. Ever since my trauma, nothing has felt the same again and after ""coming out of hiding"" last year I was overwhelmed at how different myself and the world was. 5 years of hiding can really do you in and I found myself living in the body of anxious adult and experiencing an incredibly confusing, deep, painful and emotionally draining personality crisis. Fortunately, I discovered Myer Briggs which helped me a lot and was able to surround myself with several of great people who took me in despite my anxiety, etc. Fortunately, my body has loosened up over this last year and things are getting much better but my heart still craves to become whole again...to reunite with the cheerful, uninhibited and fun-loving person who I grew up as except now as an adult. I love performing and entertaining the people around me but now I don't know how my performing would look like as a 20 year old...I don't know how  my younger self would have developed into an adult if it weren't for that trauma. I need to get my performing identity back..back when I as younger I had a feel for the world and I had a grasp over my ability to perform (what would work and what wouldn't). Right now, I don't have that performing identity . I'm afraid to perform and make mistakes since I'm older now, I'm afraid of making a fool out of myself/being misunderstood, I'm afraid of forcing things and not seeming natural. I look back at my younger self a lot and remember how he performed but I can't bring that person out anymore (completely) because I'm an adult now so yeah my performing would be different. Guys, I miss feeling happy, calm and letting my spontaneity naturally run loose. An uncle of mine who I run to for help tells me that since I'm an adult now..things are going to be different and that I can perform now by being a good conversationalist and letting witty comments fly when the occasion pops up but I know that isn't the whole story. I still don't feel ""free"" and I find that I'm still conservative socially. My younger self was more over the top, outrageous, energetic and I want to bring that side of me out again. So my question guys is..how do you perform and liven things up as an ESFP?

1793,1,"Hello there!Brace yourselves, it's going to be a long post/rant.I'm a 31yo INFJ, female, and I need advice about how to deal with my mother in law. I know, clich√©, right? :)I have been married 6 years now and I'm very happy with my husband. However, things aren't always easy when it comes to my relationship with my MIL. It doesn't help either that we live very close to my husband's family and really far away from mine (so far, and tickets are so expensive, that it's been 3 years since I've been with my family). So this kind of intensifies the problems for me because I can't go and have some ""my family"" time when my in-laws stress me out.My MIL has never taken the test but I'm pretty sure she types as ESFP. But the worse thing is that I believe she also suffers from Histrionic Personality Disorder. Now I'm no Psychologist, but she has many of the symptoms, the only one obviously missing being the seductive behaviour. She does however fit this to a T (from Wikipedia):The World Health Organization's ICD-10 lists histrionic personality disorder as:A personality disorder characterized by:-shallow and labile affectivity,-self-dramatization,-theatricality,-exaggerated expression of emotions,-suggestibility,-egocentricity,-self-indulgence,-lack of consideration for others,-easily hurt feelings, and-continuous seeking for appreciation, excitement and attention.Even if she doesn't really have HPD, that list above pretty much sums up her behaviour. I know a lot of the things she does are with good intentions. She cares about her family. My problem is that, even after more than 10 years knowing me, she doesn't really *know* me. She has picked up a few hints about the kind of thing I don't like along the way, and I'm grateful for that. But still she pursues me - I could even say sometimes I feel like she *stalks* me. For instance, like a good INFJ (or an introvert for that matter) I hate talking on the phone, and she knows that. But she will call me many times, even after my husband tells her to send me an e-mail or a message on Facebook (ah, Facebook, another one of our battlefields lol), and when afterwards we meet in a family gathering, she will put me under the spotlight and ask me really loudly and in front of everyone why didn't I answer when she called. And then I look like the evil daughter-in-law, because everyone just loves her (except for her two daughter-in-laws so I know I'm not crazy or a bitch). She will make a point of saying that she really only wants to help, to be my friend, what's the problem in calling me?When she does something that annoys me, I try to hide my feelings so not to create an awkward situation but I don't always succeed. So what I do is I try to discreetly avoid her. That's when she senses I'm kinda mad at her and then she comes right up to my face and starts noticing everything that I'm wearing and saying ""what a nice blouse you're wearing"", ""what a beautiful necklace!"" (as if it was new, even though she's seen me wearing it it tens of time and even complimented it before), or she will show me something she bought and ask my opinion about it. And I can see in her face that she doesn't really want my opinion but to assess if I'm ok with her. I wish she would just apologize for whatever it is she did wrong, and leave me alone for a while instead of coming on so strong. Once I actually hid in the bathroom the escape the MIL probing eyes and when I was in there I heard her asking where I was. Oh, dear! LOLThere are many other things she does that annoy me, especially the way she is like a toddler when she doesn't get what she wants, and the fact that she inteprets every little thing people do or say as something else entirely. She also is a little paranoid and always thinks people are talking about her behind her back or judging her, even (and especially) her closest friends. I guess it comes from her low self-esteem. Honestly, I think she's a mess and could benefit greatly from therapy, but she's also religious and will have none of that. I wish my husband and I could move to a different location so we would see her less and maybe my relationship with her would improve.I also wish she was more mature and would not act like a kid.My question for you ESFPs is what can I do to try to improve my relationship with her as it is. She sometimes tells me that she loves me but I can't say it back to her. I don't really think I love her. But what can I do to assure her that yes, she's a good person, that she doesn't have to try so hard, etc? She is really needy (see HPD symptoms) and I have the worst time dealing with needy people. But I also can't tell her some things like I would with a friend, because she's so sensitive. I think she longs for me and her other DIL to see her as our second mother, since our own mothers live very far, and she's hurt when we gently say we don't see her like that. She wants to be our friend, but our personalities clash too much. So she wants to help, she wants to be a mother figure, but it has to be her way or she'll be hurt/offended. I find it very hard to deal with this situation and I would love to hear what you have to say about it. I'm open to answer any question you might have.I am not saying that I want her to completely change for my sake and behave the way I want. I just wish it wasn't always such a struggle. Maybe sometimes she could refrain from doing something that she knows I don't like, and next time I'll do something nice for her in gratitude. It's not like I don't know how to live with Es - both my husband and my dear sister are extroverts and I adore them, and we manage (have managed, in the case of my sister when we were growing up) to live together without killing each other LOL! So it's possible, unless INFJs and ESFPs are the two most incompatible types there are!I am also posting this on the INFJ forum, it will be interesting to hear what each type has to say. :)",INFJ in

tell me that she love me but i can t say it back to her i don t really think i love her but what can i do to assure her that yes she s a good person that she doesn t have to try so hard etc she is really needy see hpd symptom and i have the worst time dealing with needy people but i also can t tell her some thing like i would with a friend because she s so sensitive i think she longs for me and her other dil to see her a our second mother since our own mother live very far and she s hurt when we gently say we don t see her like that she want to be our friend but our personality clash too much so she want to help she want to be a mother figure but it ha to be her way or she ll be hurt offended i find it very hard to deal with this situation and i would love to hear what you have to say about it i m open to answer any question you might have i am not saying that i want her to completely change for my sake and behave the way i want i just wish it wasn t always such a struggle maybe sometimes she could refrain from doing something that she know i don t like and next time i ll do something nice for her in gratitude it s not like i don t know how to live with e both my husband and my dear sister are extrovert and i adore them and we manage have managed in the case of my sister when we were growing up to live together without killing each other lol so it s possible unless infjs and s are the two most incompatible type there are i am also posting this on the infj forum it will be interesting to hear what each type ha to say infj in need of

It was a brief one, got replaced quickly (he has the attention of a goldfish), and then flared up again after a period of time in which we hung out practically every day and had fun adventures. Now unfortunately, he said this lasted for an unordinarily long time (a year), and was hard to shake out of. He would keep hoping that I would reciprocate. Thus, he's cutting off ties to move on, among other reasons.So I have several questions. What on earth would an ESFP see in an INFJ??? He certainly has more attractive, more fun friends surrounding him, and I don't fit the type of the usual girls he likes, physically and personality-wise. Secondly, is there hope to be friends? Will he forgive and forget, and stop fearing a ""relapse""?

She was in an ill-fated relationship with this other guy (everything was against him) when we finally confessed to each other. She couldn't withhold her feelings, so she told him about me and he kinda just gave up on her and is still angry at her.We went on a date to the movies soon after. The next few days were weird. She seemed less interested in me. After a long talk with her, we decided to just be friends. The next few days we hung out and interacted with each other as if nothing had happened, like two very good friends that just like to chill with each other. She was going to the homecoming dance with our friend (girl), but the friend cancelled on her at the last minute. Now she (ESFP) just told me that they were going to ask me to join them yesterday, but they forgot. I agreed to go with her to the dance tonight, just the two of us.Being an INTP, it's natural for me to seek hidden meaning or motive behind every word and action, and I recognize that not everything has a hidden meaning. Help me judge how she feels about me based on the following and what I have already told you. I've been getting mixed signals here and I need your ESFP perspective on the situation. Here are some of the things she's told me, which might not actually reflect her own feelings and were just said to deal with things in the moment, such as excuses to just be friends. What do these statements say about her true feelings?   - she has feelings for me   - she has feelings for him (the guy she was ""dating"")   - he is mad at her because his ""pride is hurt""   - I'm too clingy (I'm not at all, but must have come off that way because my previous attempts at convincing her to stay with me implied an exaggerated a desire for long term commitment)   - she wants to save romanticisms (such as holding hands) for someone she's willing to commit too in the long term (""mr. right"")   - once suggested I should give this other girl that likes me a chance (I said I wasn't into her and she never mentioned it again)I really like this girl, just everything about her. But God I wish I could just read her mind. I want to be with her and make her happy. I fell that she wants to be with me too, but her feelings change a lot and can even conflict.

1841,1,"Hey there everyone, I've taken the test once again and I've gone from ENFJ to ESFP. I guess I identify more with ESFP according to what I've read online.Anyways, I've been talking to this girl (ISFP), for about 7 months. Our relationship has been really off. She feels like she wants to be with me sometimes and others she doesn't, so its constantly back and forth for 7 months, every time I try to let her go we end up being drawn back to each other and she goes back to the unsure feelings.It's to the point where she's unhappy and stressed out all the time because she doesn't know how she feels and ends up telling me she feels so much better when she gets away from me. It's irritating because I'm not doing anything, and I've told her that none of this is my fault, and that it's all her mind that's making her problems. She knows, but says a lot of it is BECAUSE of me. So she says she's ""Don't trying to have feelings"" for me. Which again.. irritating.Everyone says move on, I know that's the 100% surefire way to get over this issue, but it doesn't work for us, We've tried NC, we've had ""space"", and tried talking to other people, but she gets super jealous when I talk to anyone, even if its just a friend on Facebook...Her plight is this, ""I don't want to lose you, and what we have, and some days you're what I like in someone, and others your not. I have feelings for you, but deep down I just don't feel it, and I don't feel like I want to be with you because I'm not excited by the idea""""So.. If that's how you feel, why are you still around?""""IDK""Are ESFP, and ISFP even compatible? We're really similar and we do have an amazing time together, really the only time things get irritating and shitty is when she starts to second guess her feelings. It just puts me through hell because one day the girl that I'm in love with is feeling things for me and its wonderful, but then at the drop of a pin somethings wrong and she is turned off by me and then things get complicated..and the contradicting, holy shit. She contradicts herself on so many things. I love all her flaws, but this is one that I have a hard time accepting. Especially when all of her contradicting thoughts are about how she feels about me.""I want to be with him""""I don't want to be with him""""I have feelings for him""""But I don't feel for him""""I don't want to lose him, but I don't want to be with him I don't think""AH, it just frustrates me even thinking about it. Before I'd get all hurt and depressed and upset. Even now when she starts saying things like ""I'm just done trying"" or ""this just needs to end"" it makes my stomach sink, but my main feelings are just ""Holy shit this is stupid and annoying, I'm not an item or a second option to you.""But neither of us can walk away. Whenever I get to that point where I feel like I can, something happens and I end up getting back into her. The ""way"" that I am that she likes, really only comes when I feel like she's into the relationship. Like shes committed or invested in a way. Or if I'm stressed out, or after an argument. I guess the shadow type for ESFP is INTJ, which she's drawn to. Idk. I'm sure you're all going to say just drop her and move on. I just needed to rant. But if you guys have any other advice on how to help her make up her mind I'd be more than happy to hear it.TL;DR: I'm in love with an ISFP that doesn't know what she wants, or how to feel about me and its been going on for 7 months.

1906,0,"I first found out about the MBTI in the supplement to a book that was actually about the Enneagram, and I notice that some people here share their Enneagram types in flair or in comments/posts. I feel my MB type is pretty clear and beyond a little bit of waffle between J and P at the beginning (clarified by aging and by function order) it's never really been in doubt, but I have always had the *hardest* time deciding where I fall in the Enneagram. Surprisingly to me, a lot of people feel that the Enneagram is more fundamental and more easy to determine a type while they fall ""in the middle"" on MB scales. I can understand being relatively in-the-middle, but to me the Enneagram just seems like kind of a random sorting of different motivations and features.So I guess I'm interested in other people's thoughts on the Enneagram - does it intuitively make sense to you? do you have to look at it a certain way to make sense of it? do you think it may just not apply to some people? - and give a little bit of history about my type. At first I figured I was a 5. I could see how wings 4 and 6, and arrows 7 and 8 kind of made sense. As looked deeper though I started doubting it - I think perhaps the arrows were reversed of what they should be? and wondered if I might actually be an 8 or a 1, it definitely didn't make sense that 5 had no connection to 1.

He sees everything in this very logical way where one thing inevitably leads to another and he rarely ever doubts his conclusions and hence tends to take strong action on them. Also, he lays very little stress on like individual opinions of people surrounding him on a action rather he would ask some people who he by some metric has deemed that their opinion is worth more than mine or sometimes even his own. He believes very strongly in his conclusions and doesn't doubt them even if they are proven wrong. Instead he would rather blame the people in the scenario for not behaving optimally as is required. He also does not view friendships as something someone should make because they resonate with the other person but believes you should make friends with people who can serve a specific purpose or who are better than you in studies specifically. He rarely ever takes feelings into consideration and things which would appear as natural to other people appear as weaknesses to him. He is very highly principled though and that is one thing I will never stop admiring about him.

( I am over 20 now). He has never truly apologized or regretted it. And I am sorry for those who say It is just an age thing, for me It is not. 13 year-old people are mature enough to know they are fucking up your brain with their actions.Since he treated me this way, I can't help but think he is a bad person. As intjs know, that lead me to doorslaming him and he basically ceased to exist for me. Problem is that during this quarantine we were more close, unable to get out and I just can't be hypocrite and pretend everything is alright. Common sense is something that comes easily for me. I don't understand why someone would be so cruel to their own sibling without any reason.Since quarantine we've been fighting a lot.

I realize this often varies person to person. But I am particularly interested in the ""why"". For example, an INTJ and ESFP can both appreciate a dinner, but perhaps for different reasons.I find INTJ's fairly low maintenance and not having that many obvious ""needs"" and ""wants"" that can be easily capitalized on. Also, the strong independence/withdrawnness makes it difficult for me to pinpoint what y'all appreciate.For example, do you appreciate a homebaked cake more than a specially bakery bought cake? (assuming the bakery bought isn't some random grocery store cake, but the gifter went out of their way to purchase something special) This has been an interesting debate amongst my friends of various MBTI, because some really zero in on the hand-made aspect, for others both are equal, and some appreciate the effort to get something nice from a special bakery and feel cared for because you were not cheap towards them.","What kind of gifts and gestures do you appreciate, make you feel special, and your reasoning as to why?

We have a very old family friends I don‚Äôt know them well. They helped me find a place, I have thanked them, called to ask how they are and went to their home with cookies. They live in a newly built area with unfinished streets, literally alleys and not much directions, it had snowed, they sent me the location, came out of car at the same place, called them and asked for more directions. Her husband and daughter came after me, I sent them my location, give as many instructions as I could and I was on the phone the entire time, the husband talked a bit aggressively and would ask where I am, what direction cars go, main street or the alley( they all were literal narrow streets  no  directions and dead ends and few one floor houses. I immediately  found  the street names and told them, they found me 20 seconds later. The husband was mad, I felt horrible and kept saying how sorry I am for three times. I felt miserable the entire time, they said I should have stayed in the car and contacted them first( logical, I totally understand). But their house was three minutes walk from where I was originally standing. I has also sent my location initially to the wife prior the the husband coming. They could literally tell me to walk straight and there I would  be, but they made a bug deal out of it( they have a logical point, I understand but walking is also an option no need for big fuss, I thought they had sent me their exact location where car took me) any ways, I felt Soooooo miserable the entire time and rarely talked, I did make few comments and asked few questions to not look too awkward.Their three daughters, son and daughter in law are all younger than me, the son in 21, bad education, smokes, drinks, is obese and tries to imitate his father( these are not acceptable traits for someone that young in our culture) now I‚Äôm the very opposite of that. I couldn't even look at the son or make comments about their dog, I felt as if the son and daughter in law (21) are much older and wiser and confidant than me, they acted very sophisticated, yet I exchanged few words with 16,18 year old daughters and felt more safe with them but still felt much lesser than them coz I‚Äôm not like them, I‚Äôm not as sophisticated, I cant make jokes and speak with a louder pitch voice, I cant sit relaxed and .... I watched their dog running around  for half an hour without saying a thing. I felt like crying, as if I‚Äôm much lesser than them  and they are judging me.I came home and felt like an idiot, it was only then I remembered I could spin of narratives, talked about something I‚Äôm good at. Sit more relaxed. Acted my age and the older one. Tell them that the street directions are bad and much different than my country so of course I would be confused but thanks for your good intentions and sorry for making you worried. I could command respect with my words and understand that objectively I have traits more worthy that their others kids( good  student, job, independence, weight loss.... , their kids and son can do whatever they want none of my business) just why is it that I feel like they are right and feel like they are ideal ( at the moment, not now) I should mirror them to be taken seriously and not judged?

1961,0,"I'm wondering if anyone else has done this in their school/work/professional life:  Perhaps to my own detriment, I have a tendency to turn down job/career opportunities if a company's mission, actions, and products and/or services don't align with my ethics and values.  For example: I was hired to be the general manager of an adventure park, and I left the position when the owner asked me to report a problem bear. My issue was that the problem bear was created by the owner who had refused to bear proof company property which left easy access to all kinds of trash etc., and that he asked me to exaggerate the bear's aggressiveness in order to have it destroyed.   I left a lucrative serving position because I didn't agree with the way the restaurant sourced its food which was problematic to me for more than one or two reasons.   Recently, I was hired at a property management company and have reason to presume I can move up in the company quickly and be compensated well, better than I have been...probably ever. But, I don't jive with some aspects of the business, and I've decided to turn down the position, which is also due, in part, to having a seasonal summer Job I love.   In school, I changed majors more than I care to admit, and most of the time, I changed because I found some ethical flaw in the conventional career paths of the majors I didn't think I could live with. But I never took up what I really loved like religions or philosophy or sociology because they weren't practical.  Anyway. I find that I pass up on opportunities quite often. I don't know that I know anyone else who does this, and I sometimes feel silly about it and like I'll never get where I'd like to be financially.

1978,0," I am having one of those times where I am frustrated at being a female INTJ. Or maybe more clearly, because I actually love who I am as a person, Im just frustrated at the way the world seems to work?? I read too many things on MBTI on reddit today and just got frustrated at like, who -really- wants to date a female INTJ??? What?? It seems like from a distance, plenty of men (and let met just say this here, Im not saying \*everyone\* Im not saying \*all\* Im just saying this has been my experience/what I see&amp;read online) seem to like the idea of dating an INTJ female from a distance. As in ‚Äòwow you‚Äôre super cool and badass and let me admire you and seem like I want to date you‚Äô. But up close and personal, it seems like they drift off to more hmm traditional gender role type women? I dont want to soften my personality or be less myself and less intense to make someone feel more comfortable.I wear dresses and skirts and do my make up and have perfume or whatever that would seem *feminine.* I don‚Äôt  mean I dislike traditionally 'female' things ‚Äì my bedroom is all pink-. But at the end of the day I just don‚Äôt really *act* girly. I don‚Äôt need a huge emotional support system. Every time I read about type combos that should work, its like either enfps or entps and intjs. But it -always- seems to be a female enfp/entp and male intj. And I understand the male intj/female enfp scenario. Stoic guy is slowly warmed up by a bubbly girl who breaks past his barriers? But I have a lot of male enfp friends and they tend to drift towards female enfps mostly. (Still want that bubbly inspiring caring personality). I don‚Äôt know too many entps. But anytime I read things on reddit it definitely seems like its again, female entps and male intjs. I know female/intj is the rarest gender/type combination. So Im sure that accounts for a lot. And I‚Äôd say 9.9/10 days I don‚Äôt even care but this morning it just really bothered me.As a metaphor, I swear it feels like most men are ‚Äòthe rock‚Äô and women are ‚Äòthe waves that crash against that rock‚Äô. And a lot of men say ‚Äòoh I wish my partner would also be a rock because this is tiring‚Äô. But whenever she stops they seem to be a little ‚Äòwait, where‚Äôd you go‚Äô. But most of the time, for most people, I -am- the rock. And I don‚Äôt really know if I‚Äôd want to find a partner who is ‚Äòthe waves‚Äô. That sounds exhausting to me too. But two rocks sitting around together? Does that even work? Tl;dr just right now, in this moment, fed up with dating as an INTJ woman.(Also like, a second disclaimer, because I know people get upset on the internet ‚Äì my intention is not to narrowly look at gender roles and not see that there is a ton of variety out there, or in any way make anyone feel bad.

In fact our N and S have clashed many times during the idea phase.

We never really have a real conversation anymore: even when I immediately respond to his messages , he goes offline. This is a behaviour I find maddening. He's a stereotypical Esfp. After some research on his type I tried to play down my seriousness and do less micro-managing. I also compliment his people skills. I would appreciate some practical advice on how to get to him. I noticed that he gets easily riled up about politics and when I once brought the subject up we had our longest chat to date (in which I mostly nodded along to his rant). To be clear: this is a project I poured my soul into for a very long time. Abandoning it or finding another partner are off the table.

1988,0," **Describe yourself in as much elaborate detail as possible (that still renders you anonymous, or to a level of acceptable comfort)**It's kind of hard for me to effectively describe myself. I am not that good at understanding my personality or emotions in great detail such that I could give a colorful portrait of my personality. It would be more of a low-resolution description if it comes from me. It actually makes me a little envious that people in the MBTI and other personality-based communities are able to understand articulate themselves. My forte is in the analysis of external non-societal systems (natural sciences, mathematics, human-engineered systems, etc.). Maybe when I'm older I will develop a level of emotional maturity to be able to understand myself. Anyways, right now here is how **I** would describe myself as:Generally reserved, private, self-focused, able to get hyper-fixated on special interest, impatient, and yeah that's pretty much all I can think of.To help with the analysis, I will add descriptions of personality from other people that I have heard over the years:Quiet, hardworking, socially awkward, intelligent, friendly, funny, analytical, lazy (this is contradictory to hardworking, it came from a highly conscientious individual commenting on how disorderly I am), blunt at times, sometimes I am told that something I have said was rude even though I don't think it was. I am also told that I have a tendency to be paranoid/worry about the future. I have worked on this and learned to control my paranoia as I am aware that it could be seriously detrimental to mental health.**Why are you interested in knowing your type?**I am curious to understand where I fall on the MBTI scale with respect to the theory of cognitive functions. I want to see how this framework maps my thinking pattern. I already took the Big 5 aspect scale and with a fair degree of confidence, I think that it is accurate (low extroversion, low agreeableness, low conscientiousness, mid openness, high neuroticism) but now I want to see how my personality fits with the cognitive theory framework.**Do you go to work and/or you in school? If so, what field/occupation/subjects?**I work as Engineer in the telecom industry. My focus is primarily on designing the systems for the device to the radio. I enjoy my job and I have ambitions of becoming a technical expert in the field in the future. I want to develop a comprehensive knowledge of the entire network from the network as a whole (radio to the core and beyond) to the physics of the wireless channel (EM waves, wireless modulation schemes, channel effect, etc).Part of doing this will involve me writing two books (it will never be published, I am just writing them for my own knowledge and fun) covering wireless communications and the other covering the network holistically. My hope is that this combination of independent research and hands-on experience help me towards my goal of becoming a reputable expert in the field.I won't be pursuing a doctorate in the subject because I have had it with schooling. I have been going to school since I was 5 and now I think I'm finally done after my Master's. I always found the deadlines and pressure to quickly get work done in school to be stressful and I don't want to go through that stress and learn on someone else's time. I would rather research and understand this on my own.**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**I had a pretty strict upbringing as a child, particularly towards academics. My parents are really big on academic achievement and grades and all that. Most of the time they focused on teaching us math and literacy skills as kids even when we're on school breaks. I think I had a decent relationship with them, but this value on academics is still ongoing and even in my mid 20s they keep pushing me to do a PhD despite the (1) It would be a waste of time to pursue it given my current situation and (2) I don't want to do another 4 years of school.I responded to this negatively initially and was a D and C student initially. Once I got to high school and through college, it hit me how important it is and I became primarily an A student.I come from a pretty secular family. I guess I'd consider myself agnostic due to the lack of any evidence supporting the existence or nonexistence of God(s).**Do you need logical consistency in your life?**I mean I don't try to pick everything apart. My way of analyzing or understanding how something works is to observe it and try to piece information together and develop a comprehensive logical analysis of why something does or doesn't work or how it works etc. I don't deliberately try to look for loopholes first. I first develop the framework and add on to it later if I need too.Hopefully, this answers the question clear enough, if not let me know so I reframe it in a way so that it can be more understandable.**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about?**I'm curious only about the stuff I am interested in and I will research that specific topic. My curiosities could be anything from electronics to a video game to a sport or really any other system. I don't have ideas that are executable, more just ideas or thoughts on how or why something functions the way it does.**If money was not an issue, what career/job would you have?**I will not work unless I am paid for my efforts. If money wasn't an issue, then I would just sit at home all day and pursue my hobbies.**Are you a free spirit or do you play by the rules? If so, why?**I'm definitely more of a free spirit and I find rules and regulations to be suffocating. I don't really know how to explain why I'm a free spirit. Guess I was just born with it?**If I asked you to take a shot with a football how would that make you feel? Would you be able to do it well? Would you enjoy it?**I don't think I would do well because I suck at team sports. Unless I was dominating, I don't think I would enjoy it.**If I asked you to write me an essay, would you enjoy it? What would it be about? How would it make you feel?**Depends on what the essay was on. If you asked me to write about something of interest then yes I guess I would find it to be somewhat enjoyable provided it doesn't have to follow the standard school report type essay with all its rules and conventions. I'd probably enjoy writing about some internal system I came up with idk.**Is it okay to crack a few eggs? If it makes an omelette? Do the ends justify the means?**As long as no one is getting hurt physically or the individual cracking the eggs is not committing a crime, then yes I think it's ok.**Do you put things back in their proper place?**This is something I have serious trouble with. It's the reason why sometimes people perceive me as a lazy slob.**How do you behave around strangers, acquaintances and friends?**I am generally reserved, private, and quiet around strangers and acquaintances. So much so that they think I am being rude. Around friends, I am generally more talkative and my sense of humor and such comes out. I can share my ideas and get into discussions with them on a variety of topics a lot more easily, I am more inclined to tell jokes, etc.**Do you have exquisite tastes that you would expend effort or money for?**I don't have any exquisite tastes. If I have something and it works and isn't a total piece of crap, then I'm cool with it.**How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**If it's within a domain of my competency then I would be thrilled to help. The reason though is because I kind of like to show of my knowledge/skill on that subject (a bit narcissistic but I'm just being honest here)**How long do you take to make an important decision? How would you go about it? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**Not very long. I actually decide on things quite impulsively sometimes. But then afterward I realize the flaws in my decision and then I start to change my mind rapidly.**If I asked you to design a plan of action, would it be easier to work alone or in a group? Do you ask for others opinion? or stick to your own guns?**Definitely would need to work alone on this. I strongly dislike working in groups because I don't like following through with the implementation of someone else's idea or their idea of how it should be implemented. I would much rather take my idea and go about my way of implementing it. Now if I run into an issue where I don't have the knowledge necessary to move on with the task at hand, then I would consult someone who knows about it and have them give me pointers on what to do next but ultimately everything will be done by me.**A weekend best spent looks like ...?**Alone at home with my hobbies**My biggest fears are ...**Failure of any kind. One of the reasons I would say for my low score in consciousness is the potential for failure which makes me fearful of strategizing and pursuing the things I want because if I pursue them and I fail then I will make a fool of myself and/or it will reveal and ugly/scary truth about reality or myself that I would not be ready to face. Most of my night terrors are based on failure lol. The other night I woke up hyperventilating thinking I failed a class and dropped out of Uni even though I'm already graduated.Another fear that I have, interestingly enough, is with psychedelic drugs. I know this sounds weird, but I find something downright terrifying about consuming a substance we know next to nothing about which is thought of as a key to ""consciously"" exploring our sub-conscious and all of our repressed insecurities and fears and how it could lead to existential dread. The fact that people come out from this experience and its potential for life long impact is scary as hell. Along with that, it shows just how little we know about anything at all which really amplifies the feelings of insignificance.**How much do you express yourself and what mediums do you do that through? Art? Writing? Talking?**I don't express myself very much. If I do I think the easiest way for me is by writing and if the discussion I am having with someone else is engaging enough, then talking.**Generally where do you lean politically? Is it every man for himself? Should people be pragmatic? Does the government need to step in and help people?**I don't know and don't care about politics.**Does it matter if something is factually correct for you to believe in it?**Yes. My decisions and opinions are based primarily on facts and empirical evidence.**Are emotions/feelings an important aspect of your life? If so, then why?**I hate the fact that I'm stuck with them. I try to ignore my feelings and emotions.**How attached are you to reality?**I don't believe I am super attached to reality. I am in my head most of the time in whatever daydream, fantasy, or train of thought I've been caught. The only time I'm in reality is if work needs to be done or if I'm engaging in physicalism hobbies like video games. But other than that I enjoy being in my own mind.**How thick skinned are you? Are you sensitive to criticism?**I would say I'm fairly thick skinned. I can take a joke pretty well and I get annoyed with people who get easily offended.",I need help with figuring out my type,describe yourself in a much elaborate detail a possible that still render

This is taking a huge toll on him. - I was pregnant and we lost our baby. He hasn't opened up much about that but he said on some level he blames himself because it was his sperm that probably caused the miscarriage (chromosomal abnormality being a common cause of miscarriage). I've talked to him about how miscarriages are common, and that it's not his fault. - He has bad asthma and hasn't been able to socialize much with family and friends because of the pandemic, he seems to avoid zoom calls for some reason.- He's so focused on his lack of employment that he seems to be forgetting there are productive things he can do. He hasn't been exercising, eating healthy or working on the projects that are important to him, he seems to be focusing on the fact that he doesn't have work and pushing off literally everything else that could lead to him feeling better. He's even cutting back on taking care of hygiene because he doesn't want to be a financial burden by needing more than the bare minimum of those products (razors for example). -  Our son (enfp) has been homeschooled because of the pandemic which makes it really hard to focus when you're inside the house, and outside of the house there aren't any quiet work areas because, again, pandemic. - He has fallen into playing minecraft more than he probably should be, because it's the one place where he feels like he's able to actually be constructive.- I'm currently holding 3 positions workwise and I know that's probably messing with him a bit too. Although one is a volunteer position. - All of these things combined are effecting our sex life as well, specifically his ability to perform. Which is consequently also effecting our ability to conceive again, which I know is also stressing him out and creating a stress loop. I love him a lot and it's hard to see him struggling like this.

2022,0,"TL;DR: just reply to my title. Below is just my situationIm 18M and my mom and step-mom recently talked about how I lack experiences compared to their days filled with flings, sex, and friends.I don't believe I lack experiences, in fact some were really exhiliarating, but I do think, in a day to day or week to week basis, my life is somewhat bleak right now. Most of my experiences were dependent on my family or their finances rather than the external world, which imo where the best experience lies because of the uncertainty, risk, and independence factors.I have 'friends' but I don't hang out with them, my friendships just stops at the couple minute conversations at different intervals. My hobbies are pretty lack luster with a self defense program(krav maga, where the last time I attended a meeting was almost a year ago) and my track and field where progress is slow.I dont just sit around and watch my life as it succumbs to meaninglessness tho(im an intj too lol). I exercise 6 times a week to improve my physique, try to ace only the most important subjects, and want to expand my hobbies to cooking and music. I also have a whole day routine that I follow strictly else my day would be full of complacency and laziness.My problem is, my plans are too gradual, long-term, and lacks space to put in 'experiences'. I thought my plan was the way to make me the best man I can be but my peers can already drive cars, into modelling, and went to crazy parties. I'm not even comparing myself to popular and successful people but just random schoolmates.I feel like im missing out; missing something. I do a lot of things every day but they're just repeats; daily grinds. I feel like to make meaningful experiences you need to go outside the box and go towards the unexpected, but you need to rely on external forces. Make friends, travel, go to events, go to concerts, create a business. I don't think im wasting my years but I'm afraid I may be doing it without me knowing.

Which means that I got to sort out what I want - considering all the pros and cons of these options...For myself, I have made a little scorecard for career opportunities (prioritised):* Challenge (both organisational and technical, content/domain, responsibilities) * Organisation (social relevance, growth possibilities, culture, flexibility)* Type of work (tactical / strategic, entrepreneurial, ability to make an impact)* Workload (total workload, ability to work 4\*9), work location* Remuneration (monetary, benefits, education/training)I would like to work on something that benefits society, but I'm afraid that this often comes at the expense of the 'challenge' which is more present in corporates/FinTech etc. I have had my own business next to university and am open to start something up myself again, but afraid that I will have less scale/impact there.

She was particularily big and was known to be a little bit of a bully. Did not have much of a relation before, but I straight up lost it. It is too far back to remember specifics but I basically ended up pinning her to the ground and choking her with my hands while on top of her until she let go of the toy and crying. I think a teacher had to stop me because I didn't let go.Obviously, this was a big deal and I got into massive trouble. My mother came and appologize that it won't happen again and the like. However, what she said on the ride back home is something that still lingers in my mind: ""I was worried that you were too nice but fortunately you are not a pathetic loser."" She said that to her 6 year old son. I didn't think much back then but damn. It was like her saying that what I did was at least acceptable. My mother was also an independent woman who succeeded with nothing but her own skills so I would imagine she had a little bit of handle-problems-yourself mentality. But still, damn. Anyways, I think that really shaped my personality from that point. In a good way, I became more independent, assertive, confident and ""pursuasive"".

2150,0,"(Thought it would be cool to introduce people who are not familiar with this. I think it has value)  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  There are 4 cognitive functions: intuition (N), sensing (S), thinking (T), and feeling (F).     The functions are divided into two perceiving (P) functions and two judging (J) functions.   Perceiving: Intuition, Sensing.    Judging: Feeling, Thinking.     The perceiving (P) functions take-in information. They do not process it. It is like a lens through which information is observed. Intuition (N) being a wide scope but with fewer detail and sensing (S) being a narrower scope but with greater detail.     The judging (J) functions process the information/ make judgment upon it:    The feeling (F) function in relation to social structure and relationships, value, personal self, feeling and such (more subjective) and the thinking (T) function on information, structure, logic, systems and such (more objective).     Each of the four functions can be in one of either two attitudes: introverted (I) or Extroverted (E).     The functions which are in an introverted attitude are directed at the inner world of the individual and tends to be more abstract as a result. The functions which are in an extroverted attitude are directed towards the outer more concrete world.     Each person has all 4 functions: two introverted and two extroverted. In every case, one of the introverted functions will be a P function and another will be a J function (one function to perceive the inner world and another to asses/ judge it). Same goes for the two extroverted functions: one will be a P function and another will be a J function (one to perceive the outer world and another to asses/ judge the outside world).     Using INTJ as an example; as this is an introverted type, the first function will be introverted, the second extroverted, the third introverted again and the fourth extroverted again (Ni, Te, Fi, Se).   \*\* In the case on an Extroverted the first function is extroverted, the second introverted, the third extroverted again and the forth introverted.     INTJ are Perceivers (not judgers or judgmental as often misunderstood) as their leading Ni function is a Perceiving function. The J at the end of INT-J makes the Thinking function extroverted (but as thinking is a secondary function in intjs, this still leaves INTJs as perceiving types).   \*\* An INFP on the other hand (Fi, Ne, Si, Te) is a Judging type since they lead with the Feeling (F) function which is a judging function (it evaluates information/ makes judgment in relation to it. In this case ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù information/ subjective).     I‚Äôve come across some misconceptions about some of these things and thought I could maybe introduce the functions here. I think as far as understanding oneself and others, the functions make a much better job of it than the MBTI/ 16 personalities test (which in my opinion is not worded well, misses a lot of information and is more aligned with the big five personality test than with the functions which Jung spoke of).

This is probably why I display INFJ traits sometimes, because of all the traits that I do have, empathy is pretty up there. I suppress it most of the time, because it brings me emotions of other people that I don't want to be experiencing. Sometimes suppressing it works, sometimes I just wish it had a turn-off button. I love being great with predicting how people would react, knowing how people truly feel, etc without them having to tell me. To me, it's power (Gee, thanks Te). And empathy has definitely made friendships stronger for me because I then use Fe/Fi to respond to them (don't get me wrong, im still very much aloof, but I do learn).Is anyone else an empathic INTJ? Remember: empathy is not all ""I know what you're feeling and I totally support you!"", no. Most of the time, it's feeling for yourself how other people feel. When they're stressed, you're stressed.

2218,0,"Hi there,As the title says, I am looking for a penpal. I am Eren (pronunciation: Aaron), 20 years old, living in the Netherlands and am an INTJ. I'm a practicing Muslim, have been practicing since a fairly young age (I consciously chose to study and eventually profess Islam myself, no spoon-feeding). People describe me as a precise, rational and open-minded person. I am someone in whose head ideas about anything and everything constantly pop up. One minute I'm pondering how it came to be that protesters invaded the Capitol (what was the starting point, contributing factors, external influences), and the next I'm pondering what is the best economic system we as humanity could/should adopt. I mean, suppose there is an alien civilization out there somewhere, and they were to visit Earth. The hypothetical fact that they would visit Earth, that very likely means that they have put aside (most of) their differences and worked together as one race to go intergalactic. Then they would come here and see us still fighting like cavemen with each other over resources, racism and other petty things. What a shame that would be then! Anyways I digress.At the moment I am studying Physics. I'm developing an app for the App Store (although this is currently on hold due to great workload)  and making youtube videos. Other than that, I really enjoy reading books and articles. I read about various topics, but what occupies me the most is religion, politics, and business with a touch of economics. I don't like fiction unless it's really, really good. Why searching Penpals?With having a penpal, I hope to find someone with whom I can spar about ideas, visions and more. Let me make this explicit: my intention here is not for the sake of friendship(s), but purely to find a conversation partner. I am very particular with whom I deal. However, after an X amount of time, I do not exclude friendship provided the correspondence is challenging/pleasant enough, of course for both sides.I am not a talkative person. When I think about something, I put a lot of energy and effort into it to come to a good conclusion. In my opinion, a correspondence of 1 to 2 times a week is a good amount. If you are also interested in something like this, please send me a private message with a description of yourself and why this penpal-thing seems worthwile for you.

2220,0,"Hello, fellow INTJs!I do not tend to post often, but I need an external point of view, on this matter. I feel torn between my emotions, and I need advice, before I go bonkers, hahaha.But, first, a bit of background. In typical INTJ fashion, I have always liked to be on my own, and to spend time by myself, even when I was a child. This independence never really bothered me, and it even helped me to build myself back up in tough times, when no one was truly there for me. Because, yes, I have suffered from bullying when I was in middle school.Since then, I have worked on my issues with my awesome therapist, and have come to understand my anxiety, and make peace with my past wounds. Why am I telling you all this? Because it might relate to the questions I have.Throughout my life, many people have told me that my desire to spend time alone is not natural. That I may have problems, or a weird personality, bla-bla-bla. And with time, I have come to internalize those beliefs. That I am weird, and not normal. And so, I feel guilty whenever I want to spend time alone. I am always watching out for when I could socialize more. But the more I do that, the more it drains me. And, on top of that, I feel like I am not being true to myself.I do not think I have social anxiety, because I can function just fine with other people. It is just that I really like being on my own. But, the people around me, mainly extroverts, constantly tell me that I should make more friends, find a romantic partner, and so on. I know they mean well, but it's starting to make me feel like I'm some kind of weirdo that will end up all alone in life. What the hell?So, my question is this : how do I feel confident about my INTJ self? How do I embrace my solitude without being guilty about it? In short: am I being normal about this? Should I make an effort to socialize more, or listen to my guts? I'm pretty lost, I guess.Thank you in advance for all your answers!

2237,0,"Sorry for the longer post, but it might prove relevant to *you specifically* lol.Critical science part: Alright so, let's clear the air here: MBTI is sort of pseudoscience. It's not the worst out there and has some basis in reality, but it's always seemed a little strange to me when people start talking about ""Fe"" and ""Dominant Ni"" or whatever. I've read a book or two about MBTI and a bunch of Jung's work (which seems to be what MBTI is largely based on), and it's mostly just speculative. Don't get me wrong, Jung is one of my favourites (am a psych student) and speculation is very fun, but I wanna be honest about what it means to be a so-called 'INTJ'. Unless there's been some cutting-edge research within the last 5ish years I'm not aware of, MBTI apparently has no real predictive power. Just from my experience, those online MBTI tests don't even seem to be great measures of things like 'introversion' or whatever else they're trying to test. That's all to say, INTJ isn't really an archetype, all it says about you is the answers you chose to give during your MBTI test.Less science-y part: If you're looking at anecdotal samples, like let's say, INTJs who also joined the INTJ sub, you're going to find lots of examples of people who seem to have similar personalities. This is especially true if you're in an environment that rewards acting like a stereotypical INTJ (ahem ahem, a sub for INTJs). Now look, I'm not juuust trying to rain on everyone's parade, because I reckon it's cool to think about grouping personality traits into types. Making a community around a neat little theory is also sorta fun and can be a good place to chat. However, the real point of this post is to tell you to not base your identity around being an INTJ, because it's not actually a real thing. If I proposed a study to a reputable psychology journal using anything remotely close to the methods used in MBTI, I'd be laughed out of the room (or... email box now? Idk). Regardless, it's also not healthy to create a self-image like that, which is probably what's going on inside a good portion of you. Hell, when I was a young (edgy edgy arrogant edgy) teenager on this sub years ago, I did that exact thing. And, to anyone who's pissed at the selfies because they shouldn't have a place in this sub, or that the people posting are ""miStYpEd""? Jesus, stop taking yourself and those four funky letters so seriously. They don't hold any power, and they barely even hold any meaning. Keep in mind, I'm annoyed by the selfie spam, I'm annoyed by any spam (and it's cool if you're JUST annoyed by the spam). But if you didn't like the selfies *before* they were spammed (be honest with yourself on this one), then I think you should take my words a bit seriously.Anyway, if you disagree, please share your view. I think the idea behind MBTI is super interesting, and would be super happy to find some sort of evidence that it isn't just a moderately better horoscope.",Let's talk about what MBTI actually is.,sorry for the longer post but it might prove relevant to you specifically lol critical science part alright so let s clear the air here is sort of pseudoscience it s not the worst out there and ha some basis in reality but it s always seemed a little strange to me when people start talking about fe and dominant ni or whatever i ve read a book or two about and a bunch of jung s work which seems to be what is largely based on and it s mostly just speculative don t get me wrong jung is one of my favourite am a psych student and speculation is very fun but i wanna be honest about what it mean to be a so called unless there s been some cutting edge research within the last 5ish year i m not aware of apparently ha no real predictive power just from my experience those online test don t even seem to be great measure of thing like introversion or whatever else they re trying to test that s all to say isn t really an archetype all it say about you is the answer you chose to give during your test le science y part if you re looking at anecdotal sample like let s say s who also joined the sub you re going to find lot of example of people who seem to have similar personality this is especially true if you re in an environment that reward acting like a stereotypical ahem ahem a sub for s now look i m not juuust trying to rain on everyone s parade because i reckon it s cool to think about grouping personality trait into type making a community around a neat little theory is also sorta fun and can be a good place to chat however the real point of this post is to tell you to not base your identity around being an because it s not actually a real thing if i proposed a study to a reputable psychology journal using anything remotely close to the method used in i d be laughed out of the room or email box now idk regardless it s also not healthy to create a self image like that which is probably what s going on inside a good portion of you hell when i wa a young edgy edgy arrogant edgy teenager on this sub year ago i did that exact thing and to anyone who s pissed at the selfies because they shouldn t have a place in this sub or that the people posting are mistyped jesus stop taking yourself and those four funky letter so seriously they don t hold any power and they barely even hold any meaning keep in mind i m annoyed by the selfie spam i m annoyed by any spam and it s cool if you re just annoyed by the spam but if you didn t like the selfies before they were spammed be honest with yourself on this one then i think you should take my word a bit seriously anyway if you disagree please share your view i think the idea behind is super interesting and would be super happy to find some sort of evidence that it isn t just a moderately better horoscope let s talk about what actually is,2809,566,0.104,0.173,0.723,0.9954

I would then stay by their side or hold them until they finished, and then they would never mention it or talk about it, even if I ask or let them know I'm open to listening.I'm wondering if this is a usual thing for INTJs.

2397,0,"I‚Äôm an INFP female and met this guy a few weeks ago. We had a great first date just getting to know each other and drinking and eventually had sex (which was also great). We texted on and off, and a couple days later he asked if I wanted to hang out again. We had another great time together and I ended up spending the night. However, after that I didn‚Äôt hear from him (at all) for a couple days and just assumed he had lost interest. I‚Äôm not the kind of person to double text or start a conversation if the other person doesn‚Äôt seem interested, so I just gave him some space and thought if he wanted to reach out again then he will. He also seems to be very busy with work most days so I tried to keep that in mind as well. After 2 or 3 days of silence he ends up snapchatting me like nothing was wrong, and we talked back and forth on snap for awhile before I finally mentioned something along the lines of how I‚Äôd ‚Äòlove to see him next week if he‚Äôs not busy but no worries if not‚Äô. He responded right away and said yes (??) even though he gave me no indication that he wanted to hang if I hadn‚Äôt said anything. Now I‚Äôm just completely confused because he never seems very interested in texting or talking outside of being together in person, and he‚Äôs usually the one that stops replying to texts or snapchats. We‚Äôve only hung out twice, but I genuinely felt like we got along really well and it normally takes me an incredibly long time to actually let my guard down and catch feelings for someone, but with him it happened so fast. I‚Äôm completely 100% fine with giving him the space he needs and taking things very slow, but I honestly can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs just not that interested and is trying to be nice by still communicating (in a half ass manner) or if this is just how he is? Does he actually want to hang out again or should I not bring it up if he doesn‚Äôt either? I‚Äôve never tried going on dates an INTJ before and I‚Äôm losing my mind trying to figure him out.

I respect their opinions and I want them to respect mine too. When i asked whether what i was doing wrong, they just said they hated them. But afterwards, when my siblings are doing them, they seem to be okay with that.Sometimes i wonder, is it worth the hate? Why do i have to be the person who is weirder than them?

2586,0,"I know we don't thrive from drama but I wanted to hear your insights about my predicament. Have you guys ever pushed away people because of the fear that you'll let someone in too close and they would judge you for stupid reasons, afraid of getting your trust broken again, etc? I don't have a lot of friends which does not bother me, I only befriend people I like or I really get along , but the twist that happened last year was that I became part of a social group that is very different from my usual circle, they're filled of extroverts, feelers, etc. I got sucked into it because of my XNFP friend -_- at first i didn't really want anything to do with them but as time flew I found myself hanging out with them very often (online). I ""feel"" like our ""friendship"" was too easy for them, like they just got close to me easily because of the XNFP, and befriending me is not an easy task lmao. I have a hard time thinking if they really are my friends because for me, they're just people I hang around with for fun but we don't really connect emotionally, and intellectually which I really value in friendships. That's why when my XNFP asked if I consider these people my friends I said no, of course he was a bit disappointed. But the question got me thinking, when the pandemic is over of course social gatherings are inevitable, maybe they would want me to hang out with them, pry into my private life which I am not ready for because the jury's still out with them and I think that they may feel differently when we really get to see each other personally because I am very reserved, quiet, and intimidating, the traits that are completely different from the online persona they have met.  So in result, I am pushing them away, I am trying to keep them at their lane so they don't get too close to me, I wouldn't be able to handle them and I'm afraid they will judge me(I come from a family that is pretty well-known and reputable, they don't know that yet and that's a factor why I am feeling this way) , betray me, and won't really understand me. I also have failed to mention that 2 people in that social group offended me real bad, that they said evoked childhood trauma and past hurt. I didn't confront them about it because I don't want to seem vulnerable and a crybaby (in this social group banter really is normal) but it's haunting me, it keeps bothering me because the two people who said that are the people whom I hang around a lot compared to anyone else and whenever they compliment me there's something in me that thinks they are faking, that they are insincere. I am planning on ghosting them for a while and I am really trying to understand myself why I am doing this pushing away of people, I have never done this before because I had no one to push away so it feel a little foreign.

2619,0,"**SITUATION:** Im living with my cousin who was diagnosed with Leukemia at the age of 17. Im not exactly taking care of her, as I was busying myself and not really putting my pride aside to offer a helping hand. She doesnt see me as someone who can really help her (more of a ‚Äúi dont want to ask my friends for help‚Äù way). Shes very clingy to her mom, who kind of spoiled her rotten. She whines a lot to her mother but never whines to me, and Im only around so she can talk to someone of similar age and listen to her teenage problems, a lending ear. But it breaks my heart to see her not even try. She‚Äôs very dependent on her mom, and always wished her mom was around even though she has a business to tend to. She speaks to her by whining, and gets angry at her mom who sacrificed so much, but also raised her to be this spoiled. She doesnt eat her veggies, and hardly has the willpower to become stronger and more that what she already is. Shes at the brink of death, and shes not even trying. **Shes stagnating, basically.**Ofcourse theres a given amount of dependency she needs, she has cancer.While recovering from chemo, she spends her days scrolling on instagram/tiktok/whatever and has a high interest in kpop. It‚Äôs difficult to strike up a deep conversation with someone who distracts themself all the time and never thinks hard about themself. She never gave herself time to become mentally strong and pull through things. **She gives up and the first sign of opposition.**Theres all these things i want to show to her like gratitude for your parents, pushing yourself the extra 1% everyday, how much people think about her, and basically become a well adjusted person after all this.The only thing i can think of is giving her the straight talk like a parent would. There could also be a gradual/subtle way of teaching this, my only idea being showing her works of fiction like streaming some great emotional story games like Undertale for her. She passively watches anime/kdramas, but doesnt really absorb it/take it to heart. So i thought experiencing fiction with her would help highlight what matters.I know her mental state is off, close to depression. Just living for the sake of it. Energy levels is akin to feeling heavy all the time (probably due to muscle loss and malnutrition) and **just wanting to lie down all day, and only finding peace in sleeping. Not wanting to face the world, nor herself.**In the end, i want her to succeed and be a great person.Note: Therapy is a very foreign idea to me and her family, its just never been on the table. It would be hard to convince her parents of hiring a therapist, adding on to the cost.**TLDR:** How can you convince a stubborn and unwilling person to become more introspective and become more independent?

Yet, we were running low on supplies so we woke up very early one day and were driving from city to city trying to find supplies but were out about 3 hours and unable to find anything. I‚Äôm not sure what the word for it would be but I have the ability to spot things faster/ better than others. For example, we were driving past a gas station and upon glancing their way I was able to spot a single case of water, inside the store, despite him driving about 50 MPH and it was only a second.We were at our 10th store when we were walking and I saw a bleach bottle out of the corner of my eye, shoved to the back of a shelf. I directed my INTJ there and he picked it up and said ‚ÄúHow did you see this?‚Äù I just shrugged and kept smelling the candles. A few minutes later, I did it again. I found a bleach container in addition to some bleach spray and germ spray on a disheveled make up aisle. We were at the back of the store... I don‚Äôt remember why we were standing still... when a man walked up to us and gestured at our cart and said ‚ÄúWhere did you find the bleach? I‚Äôve looked every where.‚Äù My spouse gestured his thumb at me and said ‚ÄúShe saw them.‚Äù We then begin discussing the pandemic, lockdown etc.He then wishes us a good day and begins to walk off. I audibly gasp, get a huge smile of excitement on my face, grab my husbands arm, shake it gently and say, ‚ÄúBaby! We have two! Let‚Äôs give him one! We don‚Äôt need both!!‚ÄùAnd then what I thought I‚Äôd never experience. The death glare. Him ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù‚ÄúYes! Baby, we only need the one, and then I got these sprays, right? Let‚Äôs give him one. Oh, he‚Äôs getting away (nudges him) baby, go catch up with him.‚ÄùMy hand was lightly resting on the cart when he *jerked it away from me* and said ‚ÄúBaby... when the zombie apocalypse comes.

Quiet, shy, a tad awkward, not very expressive, not affectionate, not flirty, not very excitable. The best word to describe him is just mellow. He seems aloof on the outside but deep down he does have a mushy core. It takes a lot of time for him to open up and trust ppl. He's had the same friends all his life, he's a very loyal guy. I think it took him years of observing me and gathering info to convince himself to ask me out üòÜ but I think once he made up his mind, he was determined to date me. Something I've come to observe about my boyfriend is how he acts when he is drunk. He's an entirely different person, like he does a complete 180¬∞. I hate to admit it, but I prefer him drunk.... He's so touchy and cuddly, always booping me on the nose, gives me kisses, hold my hand, stares at me and smiles from ear to ear, he will play wrestle with me and laugh like a little kid, tell me I'm beautiful and says I'm the best, and his sex drive goes thru the roof! When I tell you he acts the total opposite when he's sober....its like im dating 2 different guys. He can be so unromantic and acts like were in a platonic relationship when he's sober. We do see each other almost every day, and I'd say he likes to drink at least once a week when I'm over.  Any INTJs have this happen to them when they drink? Or anyone dating an INTJ have something similar happen with their s.o? It makes me wonder if drunk him is what he strives to be, but he's struggling to open up. I thought after 8 months of dating he'd open up to me, but he's still so closed off at times... it makes me wonder if he will ever open up. He has mentioned to me a handful of times he has a lot of feelings, he just doesn't like to show them.I do love my boyfriend. I am also an extremely loyal person and cant see myself leaving him. But sometimes his lack of emotional and physical intimacy does cause an issue for me. I need physical and emotional intimacy in a relationship, but he is okay with just spending lots of quality time together. I've told him I need affection and he says he does his best, but it makes him feel uneasy mostly.  Tldr:  INTJ boyfriend is only emotionally and physically affectionate with me when he is drinking. I prefer when he's drunk because he actually opens up to me. We've been together 8 months but have known eachother 6 yrs. Will he ever open up to me sober?

2695,0,"And how do you overcome that?I've experienced the pain of break-ups before but this is cutting much deeper, and we weren't even in a relationship. Whatever that was ended in May and I'm still struggling.Like today I got a piece of information from the past and now I'm an emotional wreck, and for the past year I've been on a mood of constantly feeling down. When I feel a bit better, something related to this person haunts me down and I'm down again.We dated 4 years ago, then she left because she wasn't ready for a relationship. A year after I get in a new relationship and she comes telling me she has feelings. A year later, that relationship ends, she says she has feelings, then she wants to date me without calling it a relationship because she's not ready. So we ""date"" for 6 months and then in May I ask if she'd be with me if she was ready. She said yes. Then she ""breaks up"" with me again. And today I discovered that she got in a relationship with someone else in June.I wish she was a bad person, but she's not, and that's why it's so hard to believe that I'm not unlovable, and this coupled with covid isolation is just too damn hard. Rationally I know I'm lovable, but part of my brain is resisting to believe it.

During my studies and just after I was erudite in my field. I had less hobbies than the average person, also I turned my hobby into my career, so that‚Äôs one less hobby!Now I always felt like I didn‚Äôt have nearly as much success over the years than people who had -no false modesty here- less talent and put in less work. Over the years I underperformed, was not given as many opportunities to work, even though all my efforts were focused towards the work. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm lacking success despite deploying maximum efforts over many years, compared to someone who would be much more casual. I am able to say that even though my judgement on myself is of course partial, the quality of my work is not in question, and is good enough at the very least. I do great when I am in a structure: a company or when there is a test or exam or a grant, but most of the time due to the nature of the job, I evolve in a freelance environnement where it is often more important to immediately look friendly and quickly create a bond to do networking, and where a frivolous or fun attitude is rewarded with more work compared to the stern attitude that I appear to have.Also now after a few years of a vicious circle, have less experience than people my age, so I can‚Äôt even be super competitive on work quality or experience like I used to. I did have to immigrate to a different country, speak a different language  ‚Äìit doesn‚Äôt help with friendliness when you don‚Äôt get all the jokes‚Äî and I had to restart from the bottom up a few times in different cities, but even then I can notice people who progress faster in the same environment.Long story short, I think I am a victim of my INTJ personality and I suspect people perceive me.

2784,0,"Hi everyone! Not sure if it is relevant, but I'm an INFJ.qThis is a long post, and any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. Some backstory as it is relevant:My sister is 4 years younger than me, currently in High School and loves animals. She has a knack and passion for horse riding, and despite her being quite young she has already rehabilitated a horse by herself. She has also recently picked up coding and 3D modeling, though she'll likely only keep that as a hobby.She has a hard time understanding emotions and appealing to it. She treats conversations as negotiations, and pieces of information people give up about themselves as possible bargaining chips for later. She keeps to herself as she sees no need in conversing with other humans about emotional issues, and is confused why we try and help her, or get her to communicate what she is feeling. With her current attitude towards life and relationships, she has let quite a few close friends go and the family is getting fed up with her being aloof. I'm currently the only person she talks to, is willing to try understand her, figure out the root of her troubles and try drag her out of her pit of despair. Why I don't understand her:She can't treat conversations as it is. Everything has to be a negotiation going towards a certain outcome. As such she sees little regard in being pleasant when the conversation doesn't go the way she intended. How do I help her realize humans aren't just pawns waiting to be maneuvered to her desired outcome when she pleases? (this is an exaggeration, trying to get the picture across).When you bring up the topic of her being aloof and in a pit of despair, which is most likely self-inflicted, she shuts up and refuses to talk. Why can't she see that communicating could help her solve so many of her issues and allow those closest to her a better understanding of her predicaments? She also sees little need to apologize for when she is being curt. It's almost as if she refuses to acknowledge being wrong about something, or take responsibility for her actions. This is most likely her immaturity and age coming through (17), but wondering if it might be something any of you struggled with?Right now she just wants control over her life, even if it means dropping out of school. I get that, almost everyone in their adolescent stage craved more independence, but why risk jeopardizing your life over something you'll likely achieve in 2 years time? She has a few job offers when she graduates, mostly equestrian related jobs, she is willing to let this go as well. Any idea how I can help spark that passion again for her? She isn't riding anymore, but I know she wants to and would love to follow her passion. My guess is that it's a thing of spite when looking at her need for control. Oh, and she struggles with picturing the steps to a goal. She only sees an end goal (I will master 3D modeling by October, I will code a game and do all the art in a years with no help or prior knowledge of game development, etc.). Apparently this is a recurring theme with INTJ, any advice for an outsider trying to help her understand it a bit better?","INTJ sister, struggling to understand her",hi everyone not sure if it is relevant but i m an infj qthis is a long post and any and all advice would be greatly appreciated some backstory a it is relevant my sister is 4 year younger than me currently in high school and love animal she ha a knack and passion for horse riding and despite her being quite young she ha already rehabilitated a horse by herself she ha also recently picked up coding and 3d modeling though she ll likely only keep that a a hobby she ha a hard time understanding emotion and appealing to it she treat conversation a negotiation and piece of information people give up about themselves a possible bargaining chip for later she keep to herself a she see no need in conversing with other human about emotional issue and is confused why we try and help her or get her to communicate what she is with her current attitude towards life and relationship she ha let quite a few close friend go and the family is getting fed up with her being aloof i m currently the only person she talk to is willing to try understand her figure out the root of her trouble and try drag her out of her pit of despair why i don t understand her she can t treat conversation a it is everything ha to be a negotiation going towards a certain outcome a such she see little regard in being pleasant when the conversation doesn t go the way she intended how do i help her realize human aren t just pawn waiting to be maneuvered to her desired outcome when she plea this is an exaggeration trying to get the picture across when you bring up the topic of her being aloof and in a pit of despair which is most likely self inflicted she shuts up and refuse to talk why can t she see that communicating could help her solve so many of her issue and allow those closest to her a better understanding of her predicament she also see little need to apologize for when she is being curt it s almost a if she refuse to acknowledge being wrong about something or take responsibility for her action this is most likely her immaturity and age coming through 17 but wondering if it might be something any of you struggled with right now she just want control over her life even if it mean dropping out of school i get that almost everyone in their adolescent stage craved more independence but why risk jeopardizing your life over something you ll likely achieve in 2 year time she ha a few job offer when she graduate mostly equestrian related job she is willing to let this go a well any idea how i can help spark that passion again for her she isn t riding anymore but i know she want to and would love to follow her passion my guess is that it s a thing of spite when looking at her need for control oh and she struggle with picturing the step to a goal she only see an end goal i will master 3d modeling by october i will code a game and do all the art in a year with no help or prior knowledge of game development etc apparently this is a recurring theme with any advice for an outsider trying to help her understand it a bit better sister struggling to understand her,3063,591,0.072,0.16,0.768,0.9964

Now for the past week I know she‚Äôs been under a lot of stress emotionally so I‚Äôve been trying to support her, invite her over for wine nights. Cruise with music on etc and watch movies (all covid friendly activities), and I always feel like she‚Äôs appreciative but lately we were meant to meet up a few times this week and she‚Äôll run late but fail to let me know. I don‚Äôt mean 5 mins late but like an hour late (?) The worst part about it is that she‚Äôll tell me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here‚Äù so I‚Äôll make way and see that she‚Äôs not and/or she‚Äôll say ‚Äúon my way‚Äù and show up 40 mins later.

I‚Äôm not one to harbor bad feelings so I let it go. Fast forward she did it again yesterday and blamed it on ‚Äútraffic‚Äù, to which I said fine but spoke up again and told her next time (again) just let me know.Today however was the final straw. We were meant to meet up and she told me ‚ÄúI have work sorry can we meet later?‚Äù Which was totally cool cause she communicated right?

I was at the spot we were meant to meet over the block and she goes ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know I thought you meant here‚Äù to which I responded no... I was pretty clear. So she sulked, didn‚Äôt even apologize and semi ignored me too when I asked why she didn‚Äôt meet there and she goes ‚Äúlook I‚Äôm tired and hungry, I‚Äôm just gonna go‚Äù and so I started to really get irritated and told her ‚Äúdo you not care for my time at all?‚Äù And she kept looking the other way and I said ‚Äúhello?‚Äù And she‚Äôs like ‚Äústop, people are looking‚Äù.... when she said that I kinda blew up and said ok well f people cause I care about my friendships more, and walked off. I texted her when I got home and charged my phone explaining that I was sorry for walking away but a b and c ... she hasn‚Äôt responded yet. Who‚Äôs wrong or right here? Am I mistaken in anyway?

2807,0,"I'm currently having trouble discerning the difference in Ti and Fi and applying it to myself. I am fairly certain that as of this moment in my life I am either in an Ni-Ti loop (INFJ), or an Ni-Fi loop (INTJ). For example, I hate school and how it prepares us for the big rat race, something I do not want to be associated with my destiny. I want to get what I want (an idealistic future where i'm alone and successful with no more responsibilities) in an efficient manner, which I believe school is holding me back from. However at the same time, I acknowledge that school is necessary to achieve my goal of being successful (I just hate the tedious gruelling process). I used to think this correlated with Fi, but i'm beginning to doubt myself.

2828,0,"Our personalities are determined by both our genes (nature) *and* the environment we grew up in (nurture). I'm wondering whether individuals are INTJs simply because of their DNA, or whether they had the same experiences in childhood that made them INTJs. If nurture plays a role, it means that we all have something in common. Maybe our parents had the same parenting style, or we went through an experience that made us develop some traits.For example, most INTJs don't like showing their emotions. Many of them think that showing them makes them weak. I suggest that each of us try to find a childhood experience that we think is responsible for this. So, choose a trait almost every INTJ has, or a behavior every INTJ engages in, and comment on this post your experience to see if we have a similar one. Also, I believe I and N are nature. T and J could be both nature and nurture. -**About me:**Growing up, I learned to be very independent. My mother always used to work all day, so I learned how to spend time alone and how to do things on my own, for example studying alone. Also, my mother isn't very emotional. Because of this, I never felt the need to express my feelings as a child, as I saw no point. My dad has NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder). He never really cared about me, and he was always out with his friends. Because my mother worked, he was the one who ought to take me outside to walk or play with other kids. However, he never did that. So I never learned to socialize before going to school, and I never found playing with other kids in parks exciting. If you know about parenting styles, my mother was permissive, and my dad neglecting, though sometimes acted authoritarian.When my mother wasn't working she was talking to me. We used to talk about my life from an early age. Some years later, when she wasn't working that much and I was about 9, my mom and I kept talking a lot. That may be responsible for the fact that I was more mature than other kids. And also, mom always treated me like an adult. That's all I can think of right now. They probably affect my T and J, and reinforce my I. I wonder if any of you relate.

2845,0,"I‚Äôm 23, male, and I‚Äôm a sucker for knowledge. Ever since high school I loved and enjoyed math, physics, biology, chemistry; anything that involves complex systems, and especially those that require problem solving. That second one is even more important. I spent a significant part of my high school years exploring crazy but fun ideas about physics and solving math problems and it was a high like a drug.After acing high school, and under passive social pressure, I applied for medicine and was accepted into medical school. I fell in love with the complexity of the human body and its systems. However, as the semesters rolled by, I started coming to the realization that this major is extremely memorization oriented. Now, every field requires rote memorization for its principles and laws, but this one blew my expectations out of the water. It didn‚Äôt matter how well you understand the system, you have to memorize the one and only correct and acceptable way for things and it started to bog me down. Now I don‚Äôt mind a challenge, and I enjoy discovering details within systems, but this major has required very minimum innovation and problem solving from me. The more I learn about how things work for a physician and the way our school operates, the more I realize that I‚Äôm studying to learn preprogrammed things that require little to no addition. Unless -of course- I go out of my way to go down the research route, but even if I did, I have nowhere near the right financial ground to go down research the way I want with the freedom I would want. I fantasize about being this great diagnostician who solves cases and medical mysteries, not a 9 to 5 worker following protocol.I‚Äôm in my fifth year, and my medical school has failed to make me think. All it did was make me memorize. I‚Äôve done all the thinking on my own. I find myself pushing and forcing myself to find fun in studying by doing reading different sources and making diagrams and brain maps, but it‚Äôs like pushing a car up a hill with no engine. Then I discovered programming. I‚Äôve started two months ago, with the guidance of a friend of mine who majored in computer science. And now I‚Äôm developing my own little 2D game from scratch and I‚Äôm loving every second of it. The problem solving, the pure logical thinking, the planning and building.. I haven‚Äôt  felt this high, since Highschool when I was doing math problems. But this one was even better, it included the thrill of creation. Of conceptualizing something, and then actually making it real! It combined the thrill I get from composing music or sketching or writing, with problem solving. It was -literally- everything my brain needed to be happy.I now find no problem with spending over 8 hours in one sitting trying to build an application solution, implementing a new feature, or heck, even designing a small program for the uni to help with a small task. It‚Äôs like heroine. The more I make the more I want to make.Now I ask myself.. was it the right decision to major in medicine? When theories and critical thinking and problem solving is what I really want to do?The rational part of me says yes, medical school provides a steady job, one that can support a family, and I can always do some other stuff on the side as a hobby. But the intuitive part of me keeps asking this one question: how much would I have achieved if I had pursued math, physics, or programming as a full time goal? How far would I have come?So tell me: am I irrational? Am I correct in questioning this? Did I make a mistake?","I‚Äôm second guessing my choice of study major, 5 years in..",i‚Äôm 23 male and i‚Äôm a sucker for knowledge ever since high school i loved and enjoyed math physic biology chemistry anything that involves complex system and especially those that require problem solving that second one is even more important i spent a significant part of my high school year exploring crazy but fun idea about physic and solving math problem and it wa a high like a drug after acing high school and under passive social pressure i applied for medicine and wa accepted into medical school i fell in love with the complexity of the human body and it system however a the semester rolled by i started coming to the realization that this major is extremely memorization oriented now every field requires rote memorization for it principle and law but this one blew my expectation out of the water it didn‚Äôt matter how well you understand the system you have to memorize the one and only correct and acceptable way for thing and it started to bog me down now i don‚Äôt mind a challenge and i enjoy discovering detail within system but this major ha required very minimum innovation and problem solving from me the more i learn about how thing work for a physician and the way our school operates the more i realize that i‚Äôm studying to learn preprogrammed thing that require little to no addition unless of course i go out of my way to go down the research route but even if i did i have nowhere near the right financial ground to go down research the way i want with the freedom i would want i fantasize about being this great diagnostician who solves case and medical mystery not a 9 to 5 worker following protocol i‚Äôm in my fifth year and my medical school ha failed to make me think all it did wa make me memorize i‚Äôve done all the on my own i find myself pushing and forcing myself to find fun in studying by doing reading different source and making diagram and brain map but it‚Äôs like pushing a car up a hill with no engine then i discovered programming i‚Äôve started two month ago with the guidance of a friend of mine who majored in computer science and now i‚Äôm developing my own little 2d game from scratch and i‚Äôm loving every second of it the problem solving the pure logical the planning and building i haven‚Äôt felt this high since highschool when i wa doing math problem but this one wa even better it included the thrill of creation of conceptualizing something and then actually making it real it combined the thrill i get from composing music or sketching or writing with problem solving it wa literally everything my brain needed to be happy i now find no problem with spending over 8 hour in one sitting trying to build an application solution implementing a new feature or heck even designing a small program for the uni to help with a small task it‚Äôs like heroine the more i make the more i want to make now i ask myself wa it the right decision to major in medicine when theory and critical and problem solving is what i really want to do the rational part of me say yes medical school provides a steady job one that can support a family and i can always do some other stuff on the side a a hobby but the part of me keep asking this one question how much would i have achieved if i had pursued math physic or programming a a full time goal how far would i have come so tell me am i irrational am i correct in questioning this did i make a mistake i‚Äôm second guessing my choice of study major 5 year in,3433,644,0.063,0.19,0.747,0.9985

Koreans love typing by categories anyways (ie blood types, birth destinies, zodiac, etc)-the way they write/pronounce it is sometimes different from english, for example infp would be written/pronounced as in-ph-pee. Intj is pronounced like in-tee-je. The same nicknaming convention doesnt really work for is-- or es-- types unfortunately. -saw a bunch more posts about istp, istj, and infp types.

2883,0,"Literally what the subject line says. 1. I've never felt remorse for hurting anyone. But I do feel an ethical dissonance, as if I've violated one of my rules -- by which I also judge others. I dislike feeling like a hypocrite since I don't like hypocrites. Still, there's no emotional response on my behalf that could be akin to guilt.2. I feel tenderness towards cute things. I was traumatized as a kid, i.e. beaten for punishment and also when my mother wasn't happy (started at age 4), constantly criticized as a person for every little thing I did ""wrong"", ""disowned"" a few times starting at age 10, when I was shoved out in the snow in my nightgown, observed conflict between adults, grew up mostly with just one parent, but still had happy memories and had access to education, food and clothes at all times. But I'm almost abnormally childlike when I allow myself to be -- I have strong attachments to my stuffed animals and can enjoy watching Winnie-the-Pooh. 3. I'm not impulsive when it comes to the big things -- I am considered very responsible at my workplace and with my family responsibilities (younger siblings). When I need to ""disappear"" for a few weeks of alone time, I let people know ahead of time. During these bouts of ""alone time"", I feel no need to connect with anyone, and spend my time reading, watching operas, practicing instruments, etc. I feel strongly about my work and feel a moral responsibility to do it not just for the money, but for intellectual fulfillment and for being useful to this world in some way. But at the same time the idea of never becoming someone ""significant"" hurts me -- I don't mean fame, which I find a very stressful notion.4. I manipulate without consciously trying to manipulate. It's almost as if I am always trying to get a response out of someone. I exaggerate things about myself without feeling as if I'm lying, and ""fish for compliments"" without consciously intending to do so.5. Friendships have a) mostly not existed throughout my life, and b) felt more like means of entertainment or practical mutual assistance. I'll admit that I'm judgmental and will think of certain people as not thinking for themselves -- ""mindless"", in other words, although I try not to. This in particular also makes me feel like a hypocrite, although on most days it doesn't bother me as I don't think of it. I do feel a sense of superiority at times, although as with my judgmental traits I try to suppress it. 6. I don't really have one fixed personality. There are a few ""masks"" I put on depending on the situation or the person, but I do this subconsciously, only realizing after the fact. Still, I'm considered socially awkward. 7. I am capable of blaming myself, but generally only when I fail to achieve something, and then usually less for a lack of intrinsic ability as for laziness or procrastination.8. I develop strong obsessions with subjects, ideas, or people that tend to last only for a time. I seldom revisit these obsessions. The people obsessions only happen once every 2 years or so, and no one is followed or hurt, but online stalking does occur. This never happens out of a sexual desire, but moreover out of a desire to probe someone's mind, to get to think with them rather than of them. This desire has never been fulfilled. To that end, perhaps I do feel loneliness.9. Given these obsessions, I spend the vast majority of my time detached from the real world. This isn't a physical detachment as much as a mental one, as I still like to eat well, sleep, and engage in other pleasurable aspects of being human -- just alone. 10. If this helps, I'm an 18-year-old bi woman.Sorry for the TL;DR. Just wanted to ask, since I don't seem to be fully functional. Thanks.",What's wrong with me? Psychopath? Sociopath?

I appreciate his kindness, innovativeness, energy, the fact that he doesn't pressure me, the fact that he incorporates me into his family, friends circle, projects, etc.  I do struggle with certain things, though, and am hoping to get good advice here.  I know part of my struggle is based in my own worries from growing up with a passive aggressive parent, and from having been in relationships with passive aggressive people.  (They say they are not mad, but they are.  They do this but their motivation is really that. Etc.).  I am working on myself, and trying not to ascribe past experiences to him.  I want to be the best girlfriend I can be.  But I am not sure how to think/respond/relate sometimes--especially when he is very quiet.  We are both somewhat awkward when it comes to expressing our feelings.  Sometimes I do not know at all what he is thinking or feeling and it makes me nervous.  I try not to tell myself stories in my head, you know?  This relationship is the healthiest and happiest I have ever had.  We are planning to move in together in a few months.  It is very worth it to me to not eff it up.I know every person is unique.  But if any INTJ's would care to help me with the following questions (just what you would think), it would be much appreciated.  1) When you are in a bad mood about something not related to me, what should I do/not do to make it better?  Or at least not irritate you further?  How do I distinguish between ""you are just being quiet, in your head"" and ""you do not want to talk?"" 2) When you are angry with me about something, and I have acknowledged and apologized but feel that you are still giving me the cold shoulder, what should I do? 3) When I am feeling insecure and secretly want to ask you (again) for relationship reassurance, but don't want to appear so needy, what should I do? 4) When you have (in your mind) answered a question or ended a conversation, but I feel that things were left unsaid (on my end or both ends)...but I know if I keep talking about it I will irritate you...what should I do?  (It causes me to feel angry internally for not being heard or feeling I am not taken seriously).5) It seems to me that you leave many things unsaid.  Does this mean you do not fully trust me? 6) If there is anything else I should know in order to be the best partner to you possible, what would that/those thing(s) be?

2899,0,"Hey all, I need some important advice from like-minded people here, preferably female so I can understand the perspectives from the other side.I got a match with an INTJ female on a dating app last week (we're both mid-20s). It's Hinge, so the probability of people being on there to find a meaningful relationship is higher (compared to just flings). I began messaging first and asking all the questions, pushing the conversation along (as required from males when dating). At that point I had no idea she's an INTJ although I knew she was an introvert. I touched on every info she had on her profile, and through convo I realised that our interests align extremely well. We chatted for a week and yesterday I got to have a video chat with her.  We both found out we were INTJs then. I'm seeking advice on what I should do next, or if there's no point in proceeding.Here's the important bit - I have zero idea of dating and romance in general. I know the general strategy of chatting about common interests and what not. However I have always been terrible with the wording when it comes to messages and usually come off as blunt or the recipient perceiving a message a different way that intended (which I assume many of you INTJs can relate to). As such I've consulted with my close group of friends each time before I perform an action. Every message has been perfectly crafted to hit every common interest we have. I myself have also timed my messages so I dont reply immediately to her responses (which might show I'm too desperate/clingy). From my point of view, I've handled the conversation just about perfectly. The only drawback is that my messages come off as ultra-mechanical - friends have said my messages feel too forced, artificial, and robotic. I don't deny it. Their advice is to ""be myself"" and act more natural, but I feel I am being somewhat myself by sending carefully considered messages to achieve the result I seek.Here's where it stands as of now - I think the video call went really well, we played some traditional board games online as well as pictionary (video games bein ga common interest) and chatted as well. In the call she mentioned we could play a different game next time and tentatively agreed on Wednesday evenings (our country is in lockdown due to the pandemic so we won't be able to meet at least for another month). When the call ended, I sent a message (crafted w friends) an hour later (again timed because I don't think you should reply immediately).&amp;#x200B;&gt;M (Me): ""Hey I had good fun, looking forward to the next time! Nice finally getting to meet you. Clearly I have to practice my drawing skills for the next time, yours looks good... But you looked even better ;)""  &gt;  &gt;M: ""Good night!""  &gt;  &gt;F: ""Lol my drawing of an ant was outstanding""  &gt;  &gt;F: ""Was good to meet you too!""&amp;#x200B;I gave her a compliment/flirt to steer this into a romantic path rather than the friendzone route. Of course ""beautiful"" is too cringe and I considered that a female INTJ wouldn't be too receptive to that, hence me and my friends came up with the above instead. With all of my actions, I believe it's clear to her that I'm interested/attracted to her. The problem is that my friends noticed her response was a bit lacking, and normally someone would say thanks to a compliment or something.I theorise:1. It was past midnight, and she might have abruptly woken up to my message, sent off a quick response in her groggy state, and went back to sleep.2. After the video call, she just wasn't attracted to me anymore. Our interests might align but she might not've felt a connection to me, or wasn't physically attracted to me, or (100+ reasons).&amp;#x200B;***QUESTION:***1. *Today is the day after the call. I believe I shouldn't send her a message today at all since she's an introvert and an INTJ and we all need some time alone. I was thinking of sending a message tomorrow instead, but my friends advised me that somebody not sending a message the day after a date (though this was virtual) would be the equivalent of implying I'm no longer interested in her after the video call and would ruin all the efforts I've put in so far - the equivalent of suicide.*2. *Female INTJs - How can I reliably tell if she's interested in me still after the call? In our entire conversation, I've always been the one messaging first and driving discussion on topics forward. Granted it's the male's responsibility, but at some point in time I was hoping she'd message first to indicate her interest in me still. I feel like she's losing/has lost interest in me, and if so I wished she'd just tell me instead so we can both stop wasting each other's time.*P.S.: I am terribly sorry for the length of this post, especially as my first in this subreddit. I've just been overthinking so much over everything that my brain is melting. It's hard for INTJs to find someone they're attracted to both in appearance and intellect and I fear if I mess this up I won't find another one for years.

2905,0,"I had a session with a therapist a few months back and to be honest I got absolutely nothing out of it. I went mainly because an ex (5 year relationship) had recently resurfaced in my life in a big way and stirred up some emotions I thought I had buried long ago. My work offers a free counselling service even for non-work related issues, so I thought I'd give it a try.It was over video call and was basically me talking to her about the ins and outs of what had happened with me and my ex. Now I expected I'd have to spend some time talking about that stuff, but I also expected some sort of advice or guidance back from her too. Instead I got nothing. I think the best tidbit of advice she had for me was when I was talking about how I dealt with things after our initial breakup, and I said how I'd just try and think of something else, something positive, and my mind would quickly move on. And she said yes, that seems like a good strategy you could use again now... Well yes, and I have been, but it's not a solution, it's a band aid that deals with the symptom not the cause.Yes, that pretty much sums up what I gleaned from the session. Then at the 50 minute mark she says ""whelp, that's it for this session. If you'd like to book another session please call the same hotline number blah blah blah"". I was shocked. I was at least expecting maybe for the last 5 minutes she would do some talking and offer some insight.

Why not?, the internet is a great place for people to find like minded individuals. Find and surf the INTJ subreddit and it's all about stereotypical nonsense that a quick Google can provide. ""I'm unemotional, people get angry when I speak the truth, etc."". I'd be interested to know the statistics of how many folks are only pretending / wishing they were INTJ and using Google to fake the part. It doesn't matter, I'm just naturally curious.Anyway - **INTJ isn't a box to live in. It's a starting point, and like all starting points it's not the place you should still be at when the journey ends**. My free advice, feel free to ignore, is to read on the INTJ for informational purposes, to get a baseline of your likely strengths and weaknesses, then go fix them. Example:  I scored very high in the introverted space, but my job requires I lead project teams. I practiced, forced myself to step out of my comfort zone, and kept seeking feedback to gauge progress. Now I can hold my own facilitating large groups, and when I'm done I default back to my introverted nature and go to my room to recharge.As humans we possess both introverted and extroverted genes. We are not limited to using one or the other.

2945,0,"Just like many kids, my parents were making me believe in Santa. But I always knew it is impossible because of the obvious inconsistencies - like that, if he gave presents to all the billions of children in the world (yes, I knew the then world population), he would spend less than a millisecond to each house, yet some people claimed they have seen him, which requires at least several seconds. Also we had no chimney, our door was constantly locked, there were no flying raindeers, and so on. But every time I raised these arguments and said Santa is impossible, my parents used to say ""I don't know."", tell me it works in some magical incomprehensible way, or ask me how is it impossible when Santa is the one that brought me the presents the previous year. And everyone else I asked would tell me he is real. So I  either had to accept the obvious insanity of Santa being real, either had to accept that everyone I ever met was lying to me about some unimportant for him/her thing for no reason. The latter was some conspiracy at the level of the simulated reality conspiracy or the Truman syndrome. And this continued for way too many years. I was getting psychotic because I had to choose one of two obviously impossible things. At some point I was questioning reality.And there are still some people who justify that lie. They say it is nice and cute for children to believe in something impossible if it makes them feel good. This is supposed to be a white lie. But the same kind of ""*white*"" lie can be ""*justified*"" for adults too, in situations where it's obviously not justified. Like when your girlfriend/boyfriend has cheated on you but doesn't tell you so you don't feel bad. Or any kind of propaganda lies. And in most cases it's not even a ""*white*"" lie, because parents fear confronting their child for the fraud they have done, so that changes their motives from altruistic to egoistic.So when I was 10 and I for the nth time asked my mother whether Santa is real, she finally said no. Then I asked her why had they been lying to me for so long and she simply said I had been too young. That was the most disrespectful and humiliating moment in my life.I am posting that here because I honestly don't know where to post it. I just hope to find some people who think like me, had similar troubles, or at least understand me, believe me and don't think I am insane. I thought the INTJ personalities are most likely to fit that.",Santa Claus,just like many kid my parent were making me believe in santa but i always knew it is impossible because of the obvious inconsistency like that if he gave present to all the billion of child in the world yes i knew the then world population he would spend le than a millisecond to each house yet some people claimed they have seen him which requires at least several second also we had no chimney our door wa constantly locked there were no flying raindeers and so on but every time i raised these argument and said santa is impossible my parent used to say i don t know tell me it work in some magical incomprehensible way or ask me how is it impossible when santa is the one that brought me the present the previous year and everyone else i asked would tell me he is real so i either had to accept the obvious insanity of santa being real either had to accept that everyone i ever met wa lying to me about some unimportant for him her thing for no reason the latter wa some conspiracy at the level of the simulated reality conspiracy or the truman syndrome and this continued for way too many year i wa getting psychotic because i had to choose one of two obviously impossible thing at some point i wa questioning reality and there are still some people who justify that lie they say it is nice and cute for child to believe in something impossible if it make them feel good this is supposed to be a white lie but the same kind of white lie can be justified for adult too in situation where it s obviously not justified like when your girlfriend boyfriend ha cheated on you but doesn t tell you so you don t feel bad or any kind of propaganda lie and in most case it s not even a white lie because parent fear confronting their child for the fraud they have done so that change their motif from altruistic to egoistic so when i wa 10 and i for the nth time asked my mother whether santa is real she finally said no then i asked her why had they been lying to me for so long and she simply said i had been too young that wa the most disrespectful and humiliating moment in my life i am posting that here because i honestly don t know where to post it i just hope to find some people who think like me had similar trouble or at least understand me believe me and don t think i am insane i thought the personality are most likely to fit that santa claus,2351,460,0.148,0.087,0.765,-0.9878

2957,0,"At the risk of coming across as ""not like the other girls"" (which is not my intention, at all), I feel more and more like an island each day. I've kind of always felt this way, like I can't relate to most people, like I don't belong anywhere. I was bored in school, because I learned the material quicker than most of my peers, so I turned to secretly writing stories because it looked close enough to note taking. When the other kids played on the playground, I would sit on the blacktop and write, or sometimes read. In high school, I had no desire to go to parties or get drunk or have sex (honestly, I was later in the game of romantic/sexual attraction than anyone else I knew; I never had those 5th grade ""boyfriends"" all my friends had, nor did I want one, and wasn't even remotely interested in sex until I was 18. I've had maybe 6 or 7 crushes in my entire life, including serious and not-so-serious, which felt isolating all the time. I didn't have my first crush until I was 14).Long story short, I'm 21 now, I graduated college early, got a full time job as the youngest person at my company at 19, moved out on my own completely. I enjoy living alone and having this independence but it's only furthered my feeling of just being isolated or just like no one really understands me (this sounds so emo lol, I don't know how to phrase this properly though). All of my friends are still full time students living at home. They don't have jobs, they don't have bills; they have curfews and complain to me about their siblings and parents, and meanwhile my qualms are more along the lines of worrying about work and rent and other things. More than ever, I feel a lot older than anyone my age.Most of my coworkers are in their 30s and up. I relate to them a little more, but a lot of them have kids and whatnot and there's a generational gap too, obviously.So I sort of feel as though I have no peers, which is how I felt all my life, it's just been magnified the past few years. Mostly I'm okay with it but sometimes I just want to fit into the mold and belong somewhere.TL;DR: do you ever feel, or have you ever felt, like everyone else in the world is different from you?

2958,0,"So, as the title suggests, I‚Äôve always found my mind being crowded by totally different ideas and thoughts all at the same time, and I‚Äôve finally decided I need to see that I‚Äôm not alone in this.I‚Äôve been finding myself, when watching movies, to pause it after almost every conversation, and talk myself through the plot and setting step-by-step to ensure I know exactly what‚Äôs going on, then thinking about the same thing when going to sleep. I did this recently while watching the Dark Knight Trilogy and The Witcher Netflix series, for example, where after every conversation I would rewind to ensure I‚Äôd heard every single word and knew exactly what was going on, even pausing to look up words I maybe didn‚Äôt know or names which I did not recognise, even sometimes when the point was that I wasn‚Äôt meant to know who the person was at that point.I hate it in a way, because it totally disconnects me from the story itself. I think it‚Äôs partly because the way my brain works I constantly have so many thoughts racing through my head that I try to focus on the words being said, that they just lose all significance to me and it‚Äôs just... words... then I need to rewind because I just repeated meaningless words in my head and they lost all meaning. Furthermore, I then begin doubting my cognitive capabilities since I need to take so much time to understand a plot and characters, but at the same time I wonder if it‚Äôs just down to my analysing nature that I need to know every tiny detail so keep going over individual scenes to dissect words and phrases to pick apart implications and points in a story where a normal person would take it at face value.I feel like I can‚Äôt even express it properly through text, but I hope you know what I mean. I guess I just want to know if this is to do with my being an INTJ, constantly going back to and analysing tiny details in insignificant scenes because I just *need* to know what‚Äôs actually going on or being said at that point. There‚Äôs also a few personal reasons why i could be seeing things in such an overwhelming manner - I‚Äôm in my last year of high school right now, trying to decide my next move in education, doing online classes where I may or may not be doing my final tests, so I have a lot going on and a lot of uncertainty in my head at the moment too regarding myself and my future, so it‚Äôs pretty hard for me to switch off as it is.My minds just so crowded with simple things - video games I want to complete, movies I want to watch, series I want to watch, YouTube videos I want to watch, not to forget the constant shadow of school and a responsibility to myself to ensure I maintain my education and intelligence, and I‚Äôm trying to balance all this with trying to maintain somewhat of a social life, sacrificing time I‚Äôd otherwise be putting towards crossing things off the ‚Äòlist‚Äô of things I actually want to do as listed above to instead do something I‚Äôd be happy enough without doing.So yeah, do you understand what I‚Äôm getting at and if so do you see this as more down to my analysing/critical nature in that I tend to fully think through and dissect every little thing I come across or experience, or could it potentially just be to the personal events in my life right now sort of piling on top of each other?",Way too analytical for my own good?,so a the title suggests i‚Äôve always found my mind being crowded by totally different idea and thought all at the same time and i‚Äôve finally decided i need to see that i‚Äôm not alone in this i‚Äôve been finding myself when watching movie to pause it after almost every conversation and talk myself through the plot and setting step by step to ensure i know exactly what‚Äôs going on then about the same thing when going to sleep i did this recently while watching the dark knight trilogy and the witcher netflix series for example where after every conversation i would rewind to ensure i‚Äôd heard every single word and knew exactly what wa going on even pausing to look up word i maybe didn‚Äôt know or name which i did not recognise even sometimes when the point wa that i wasn‚Äôt meant to know who the person wa at that point i hate it in a way because it totally disconnect me from the story itself i think it‚Äôs partly because the way my brain work i constantly have so many thought racing through my head that i try to focus on the word being said that they just lose all significance to me and it‚Äôs just word then i need to rewind because i just repeated meaningless word in my head and they lost all meaning furthermore i then begin doubting my cognitive capability since i need to take so much time to understand a plot and character but at the same time i wonder if it‚Äôs just down to my analysing nature that i need to know every tiny detail so keep going over individual scene to dissect word and phrase to pick apart implication and point in a story where a normal person would take it at face value i feel like i can‚Äôt even express it properly through text but i hope you know what i mean i guess i just want to know if this is to do with my being an constantly going back to and analysing tiny detail in insignificant scene because i just need to know what‚Äôs actually going on or being said at that point there‚Äôs also a few personal reason why i could be seeing thing in such an overwhelming manner i‚Äôm in my last year of high school right now trying to decide my next move in education doing online class where i may or may not be doing my final test so i have a lot going on and a lot of uncertainty in my head at the moment too regarding myself and my future so it‚Äôs pretty hard for me to switch off a it is my mind just so crowded with simple thing video game i want to complete movie i want to watch series i want to watch youtube video i want to watch not to forget the constant shadow of school and a responsibility to myself to ensure i maintain my education and intelligence and i‚Äôm trying to balance all this with trying to maintain somewhat of a social life sacrificing time i‚Äôd otherwise be putting towards crossing thing off the ‚Äòlist‚Äô of thing i actually want to do a listed above to instead do something i‚Äôd be happy enough without doing so yeah do you understand what i‚Äôm getting at and if so do you see this a more down to my analysing critical nature in that i tend to fully think through and dissect every little thing i come across or experience or could it potentially just be to the personal event in my life right now sort of piling on top of each other way too analytical for my own good,3214,622,0.031,0.081,0.888,0.9836

2964,0,"To be more specific, falling in love with one intj that doesn't have the same feeling for me is the hardest thing I've done ever.  Hello my fellow intjs, I am a 25 year old ENTP(female) and recently feel like living in the hell. And yes, I fell in love with an intj (male) . We've known each other for more than one year and are exclusive fwb (does this really exists). At first, it is just like, and I am very confident that I could manage that. To be honest, I am always someone who could detach very quickly. But with all the good/deep conversations, laughs and happiness that we had, one day I just suddenly realized that I love him. And at the instant, I know he wouldn't feel the same way because he never fell in love with anyone and think fwb is the best choice. I was an idiot as a first time fall in love person, I thought even though he doesnt feel the same way, it is fine. He is so intelligent, funny and cold outside but sweet and kind inside, so I chose to stay with him and  let myself falling and falling.But things are not as easy as naive old me thought. Falling in love with someone who doesn't love you back makes you doubt yourself. Maybe because I am not beautiful, because I am not funny enough and so on. And I lost my happiness. One night, I just told him anyways. He was a little surprise because I told him I also never loved anyone before. He said he appreciate that and I am the first person who truly love him except his family and it is a really nice experience and also he loves but in a different way. Although I knew his answer long before, but actually heard it is so much pain. Recently Im gonna move to another country and might never come back. I am so sad that I am leaving him and cried a lot a lot. Realizing he also does't feel the same kind of sad makes me feel even more sad and pathetic.

2979,0,"First off, probably more of the issue than Ni for some of this, I have an anxiety disorder. Just to keep in mind.Understanding patterns, ""sensing"" the future, having insight on how people think... sometimes it's too much. Especially when (and I'm not trying to sound all ~so different and smart~) most people I know don't understand or care. The other day my friend got me a ""surprise gift"" and I wasn't surprised. At all. I knew, off of next to nothing, she was getting me a gift and what it was. I didn't tell her I wasn't surprised, but it bugged me.I've taken note of and studied human behavior most of my life- being so aware of how people are likely to act/why people do the smallest things- sometimes it's irksome. And not even in a ""oh, this person has mistreated me, but I understand their pain and can't be mad"" way, though that does happen. But more in an ""all this information I can't even use or talk about just knocking around my head""I think far too much and didn't even realize it until yesterday. I was talking to my sister, having an off day, trying to function. I asked her why I was struggling and she told me I was stressed. I told her ""I don't feel stressed, I don't understand, why?"" (or something to that affect) She said ""You think too much,"" and I started explaining why I may or may not think too much and what it felt like and--- she just simply said ""literally look how much you just thought about the idea you might think too much.""It's hard to understand certain things about yourself when they are how you've always been. Hard to identify the abnormal or the problems if they've always been your normal and you're used to accommodating them. So yeah, I guess I ""think too much"" and it gets in the way.I'm an enneagram 5w6, which probably explains a bit. Learning and being involved in ""deep thinking"" and intellectual pursuits makes me feel safe, but having that much info in my head, or even just instinctual insight- it can be much.  Esp talking to people. And it's not that they aren't as smart as me, I don't think that *at all*, it's just a baseline of knowledge can be required and it's not everyone's ""*thing*"". And I can't explain the meaning behind every statement.But yes, this is very much stream of consciousness. Please say whatever you'd like in a kind and constructive way.

2997,0," Hi,this weekend I had a girl over which I have been seeing for about a month. From the first moment I knew I like her, I wont describe that in more detail, as it is not important, but I really do. On Saturday we had some deep talk and she talked more about herself and about us when we first started seeing each other. To make the long story short, she has some mental problems related to feeling worthless and insecure, she told me a lot of scenarios she came up with and went through with her friends regarding us. From this I could say she really liked me, if what she said was true. In the evening, when we talked more deeply she said, that at one point she wanted to stop texting me, as she felt like she is just not good enough for me, that I deserve someone better, but could not. I asked her to simply answer whether she wants to be with me and she said very quickly ""yes, of course I want to be with you"", after that we both said we love each other. The next morning we cuddled for like 3 hours in bed, she said she did not want to let go of me as she knows we wont see each other for another week. We had great sex afterwards.The problem is, I read on some red pill and relationship subreddit that women always say this when they want to get rid of you, but don't want to hurt your feeling, but I hope in this context in might be different. Also her texting pattern changed, she usually hates texting, but todays has been replying a lot quicker with more in depth information.So in the end, do you think it is really possible she loves me ? What do I do here, should I be there for her, or will being a supportive person ruin the relationship and the dynamic ? I want to let her know that I really view her and fully equal, and don't want her to feel that way, but I am worried that trying to do this will ruin the dynamic.Lastly, I am posting here mainly, because we are both INTJs, even though I cycle between ENTJ and INTJ and found another similar  post here. A lot of dating/relationship subreddits seems to be full of people which tent generalize out of context saying ""this always means she does not like you"" or ""you cant express so many feeling for her or you will become her dumping bag"". I suppose here I cant get some more constructive answers, perhaps from people who experienced something similar. Thank you. Thank you.",Is this a sign she does not actually like me ?,hi this weekend i had a girl over which i have been seeing for about a month from the first moment i knew i like her i wont describe that in more detail a it is not important but i really do on saturday we had some deep talk and she talked more about herself and about u when we first started seeing each other to make the long story short she ha some mental problem related to worthless and insecure she told me a lot of scenario she came up with and went through with her friend regarding u from this i could say she really liked me if what she said wa true in the evening when we talked more deeply she said that at one point she wanted to stop texting me a she felt like she is just not good enough for me that i deserve someone better but could not i asked her to simply answer whether she want to be with me and she said very quickly yes of course i want to be with you after that we both said we love each other the next morning we cuddled for like 3 hour in bed she said she did not want to let go of me a she know we wont see each other for another week we had great sex afterwards the problem is i read on some red pill and relationship subreddit that woman always say this when they want to get rid of you but don t want to hurt your but i hope in this context in might be different also her texting pattern changed she usually hate texting but today ha been replying a lot quicker with more in depth information so in the end do you think it is really possible she love me what do i do here should i be there for her or will being a supportive person ruin the relationship and the dynamic i want to let her know that i really view her and fully equal and don t want her to feel that way but i am worried that trying to do this will ruin the dynamic lastly i am posting here mainly because we are both s even though i cycle between entj and and found another similar post here a lot of dating relationship subreddits seems to be full of people which tent generalize out of context saying this always mean she doe not like you or you cant express so many for her or you will become her dumping bag i suppose here i cant get some more constructive answer perhaps from people who experienced something similar thank you thank you is this a sign she doe not actually like me,2281,463,0.098,0.145,0.758,0.9761

3010,0,"It's my birthday, I woke up at 1am because of a headache and wrote this. I'm not going to do anything bad besides a lot of overthinking and obsessive planning for every possible situation I could possibly end up in, just like I always do (could be an INTJ thing, I suppose). This is not intended for a cry for help, I'm genuinely curious about your thoughts on this. I hope understanding your perspectives could inspire me to change some neural pathways and to be helpful for those who participate in the discussion.I've been having s\* ideations/thoughts for 3 years, having depression for longer. I believe the root of it (tho not the only reason) is out of me being dissociated from negative feelings since childhood. As a result, I neglected my feelings while making decisions, operated under what I thought of as logical and rational decisions. It made me feel in control, but also robot-liked and didn't believe much in free will (Since when emotion is out of the picture, there always exists an easy best choice for any multiple-choice question. Since we have limited information about the world, given what we know at the moment, the choices are always enumerable, thus the multiple-choice question.). Only via depression, I discovered an emotional self, one that's malfunctioned, not fulfilled.I strongly believed in neuroplasticity, it's never too late to become someone you would like to be. But what if for me, the reward along the way will not outweigh the effort it takes to change the wiring of the brain (and an imagined relief obtained from s\*). What if my logical self and emotional self come to the same conclusion to end this at some point.Sounds like I'm afraid of the future (for you reading: this uncertainty is supposed to also bring excitement and opportunities and positive changes), yes, because I'm afraid to feel extremely lonely forever and it's an inevitable curse to be human. And would be extra hard when you feel like a misfit.Thank you, I appreciate you spending your time and intention for reading (as they are the most valuable one can give).

I like films and music too and spend time absorbed in them.Despite the fact that I would describe myself as bookish and thoughtful and even intellectual, I‚Äôm coming to realize that I‚Äôm just not very smart. It‚Äôs  pretty demoralizing. Honestly, most people, I think,  assume I‚Äôm somewhat slow and stupid, incompetent at the very least, and easy to manipulate. I was told by my friends I would be the most likely to join a cult. You know how some people are just ‚Äúsmart as a whip‚Äù and very witty and articulate and mature. Well I‚Äôm the opposite of that. When I talk about my ideas they don‚Äôt really make sense or sounds very good to others. I don‚Äôt know a lot of general knowledge even basic things, and even when I learn them, I can‚Äôt remember stuff about US history or geography or just the world at large. That stuff can probably just be fixed by practicing but there are other things. For instance, I am bad at following movies and even conversations. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on a lot and when all of my friends can predict what‚Äôs going to happen I am amazed and frustrated by my inability to participate. I am horrible at almost every group activity, be it a puzzle or a game of cards, I feel like I‚Äôm nearly always the worst one. I always say stupid things and get things VERY wrong about history or world affairs. People are generally nice to me but I have been teased on occasion for being stupid and an airhead. Sometimes people are amazed at how stupid I can be. I am known as ‚Äúspacey.‚Äù I have ADD but I‚Äôm medicated.

While she was everything I could have asked for initially, and the conversation was absolutely remarkable due to her creativity -- I began looking at the bigger picture and focused on what qualities I would need for happiness and growth in the long-term.I then met a few INFP's and I am now completely convinced that INFP's are in fact the true MBTI match for an INTJ. It makes sense, they are way more calm and collected, deeper, thoughtful and considerate of your opinion and share most of the qualities of an ENFP but just projected inwardly. I feel due to the extroverted nature of the ENFP they are able to sing and broadcast their qualities a lot more and that's why they get all the attention. Hence all the Youtube, reddit posts etc about this apparent dream match. They are simply out-shining the INFP's, because that's what they do and are extremely good at.So it appears to me that while ENFP's are indeed a good match at first sight, and don't get me wrong I'm sure there are plenty of healthy, happy INTJ-ENFP relationships and if they work then it would be extremely blissful I'm sure...BUT, if you're still a single, stable, chill INTJ -- try find an INFP and give them a shot, you may be surprised...NOTE: INFP's will be much, much more difficult than finding an ENFP, but hey, ya gotta put in the effort.","The unsung hero, INFP's vs ENFP's for INTJ relationships?",though this is just my opinion through my own personal experience i see all the time online that enfp s are the one best suited for relationship however i noticed conflicting opinion that enfp s are way too flighty too hyper too chameleon like etc this wa confirmed when i dated an enfp for a short time while she wa everything i could have asked for initially and the conversation wa absolutely remarkable due to her creativity i began looking at the bigger picture and focused on what quality i would need for happiness and growth in the long term i then met a few infp s and i am now completely convinced that infp s are in fact the true match for an it make sense they are way more calm and collected deeper thoughtful and considerate of your opinion and share most of the quality of an enfp but just projected inwardly i feel due to the extroverted nature of the enfp they are able to sing and broadcast their quality a lot more and that s why they get all the attention hence all the youtube reddit post etc about this apparent dream match they are simply out shining the infp s because that s what they do and are extremely good at so it appears to me that while enfp s are indeed a good match at first sight and don t get me wrong i m sure there are plenty of healthy happy enfp relationship and if they work then it would be extremely blissful i m sure but if you re still a single stable chill try find an infp and give them a shot you may be surprised note infp s will be much much more difficult than finding an enfp but hey ya gotta put in the effort the unsung hero infp s v enfp s for relationship,1612,316,0.027,0.177,0.796,0.9934

We just understand each other And everytime, we discovered more stuff about each other that made things more interesting. The charisma was undeniable.However, being an INTJ doesn't mean that the person doesn't have psychological problems. Claiming that she was in a narcissistic family and had an abusive father was a big red flag to me. A lot of people who had such rough childhood tend to exude the traits they dealt with in the unhealthy household. All stems from negative experiences such as Abandonment, stonewalling, etc.All I had to do is to back off a little bit to test my theory and damn was I right!She just ghosted me right away. All I did was just back off a little bit to see how she will react. She texted me that I haven't talked to her since our last date -which was 3 days ago- and that I came across her mind. I simply replied that I was busy with my band writing music and that I missed her and I would love to see her.

3098,0,"Fellow INTJs! Could you please help in typing me...?  Am I an INTJ or INTP (or neither...)? Can anyone tell?  I initially thought I was an INTP.  INTP was great, I thought ""Oh my gosh finally, I actually found my type"", and it made me feel proud and like I could finally relax on trying to research types endlessly to find the right one. This was it. It took SO long for me to finally come to a conclusion, I was glad to be done with it so I could move on and feel confident in relaying my MBTI identity.But then, as I always do, I never stop researching and pursuing my urge to confirm or deny my suspicions over and over again. Because I can never just leave a new good thing I've found that works alone until I've analyzed from every single perspective and angle and relation possible (which is literally endless) to make sure it's just 100% perfect. Spoiler alert, I never get to that conclusion that it's perfect.  So I continued to exhaust every single resource I could find, over and over again throughout multiple days, to just make sure that that LITTLE inkling of curiosity ""what if I'm not this type/Am I for SURE this type, though?"" was satisfied.   Then I really delved into INTJ and I had a way more powerful eureka than I did with even INTP. It was absolute GIDDYness, it was empowering, it was relieving, it was finally being understood by myself and the world. It clicked, it connected, it resonated... I could almost cry at how much every little detail resonated! I couldn't stop smiling that night.  Then the next morning, I had to go over ALL of my findings again, checking even more new resources, insisting that I make sure my typing was FLAWLESSLY accurate. It was for sure either between INTP or INTJ, I just had to be certain which it truly was. I still have doubts/concerns that maybe I'm still directing myself in the wrong direction and that maybe I'm not either of those, but I really feel like I am. And if I'd felt such resonance before, that has to mean something, right? I keep trying to tell myself that it does, yet I can't help but dismiss it.  Again, as I always do, I started to doubt myself and my feelings as I read more and more. Certain things lost their clarity as I searched and searched my experiences and what fit to what I was reading.  Every single day, I seem to look at things from a different point of view, or rather I consult a different method of perceiving and reasoning with my feelings each time, and I really do feel like it does me worse than good. Not one, not ONE, thing in my personal life feels like I have my act straight in.  I can't stop thinking about what may or may not be real for me and what my case would look like to others if they examined it, just trying to compare everything for that one definitive result.  Now, what felt so right just the day before, predictably, lost its' passion to the what-ifs.  I even read this whole guide for INTJs, and several glorious INTJ tips for way of life, and I felt so good. I felt like I finally had direction and knew how to once and for all improve the stasis of my life and mental health, and then I lost it like I always do.  I went down the rabbit hole of endless self-analyzing and criticism on my experiences, trying to find proof *not* that I'm an INTP, but that I'm not *INTJ*.  I keep thinking, oh maybe this INTP thing vs this INTJ thing is right about me after all, not the other way around, even though just last night I thought the exact opposite thing with much more confidence and gusto.  But then, I read about the ways of cognition for INTP, and it literally makes me feel almost queasy. I feel so viscerally uneased and anxious. The way their feeling plays more of a part than an INTJ is what I feel like I've actually kinda done in a lot of my life to try and please others, and that's exactly what I've been trying to escape. It's never felt right to me, and it's caused me so much grief and damage, thus I've come to identify it as a great issue in my life that I've known needed to be resolved. Does that mean I'm not INTP, then, or?  Like the ways INTJ does things; Thinking of the whole picture and the way things systems of everything react, not having to worry about feeling and just being allowed to be objective, making routines and plans, all sound and felt EXACTLY like the assertive guidance I've been looking for.  I don't feel I'm good at some of those things, but it feels like I'd be capable of them if I just get comfortable with them, since I've never done those things for what feels like more out of lack of direction and self-confidence than lack of ability.  I've always tried to deny myself and every way I think or feel, so it just feels like I've damaged my clarity on how to be what I truly am and put the skills an INTJ typing has to use. I could heal it over time, and I want to try the tips because it felt right, but now that I'm worried again on if I'm an INTP instead, I've pulled back and feel completely stuck and hesitating on even wanting to at least TRY it before I knock it, because I worry it's somehow going to make my life worse if it ends up being NOT right for me because I'm truly an INTP, and/or maybe I'm equally concerned that I'd just be an imposter.  It feels like it'd help me so much, but what if it doesn't? What if I get there and it doesn't come as naturally to me as it does others? Or what if that'll NOW be the case now that I've doubted myself and am no longer as confident in it, like a self-fulfilling prophecy of self-sabotage?  I get myself to one finished piece of the puzzle that looks right, and then I find myself anxiously searching to make sure it's the right one and that I didn't just jam that one into place by mistake.",Am I INTJ or INTP?,fellow s could you please help in typing me am i an or intp or neither can anyone tell i initially thought i wa an intp intp wa great i thought oh my gosh finally i

I‚Äôd like to know your opinion about a situation I came across too many times.Sometimes, when I am bored, I like to express my opinion about various topics on the internet.I always start with a ‚Äúthesis‚Äù.I am never aggressive as I enjoy sharing ideas with other people.I explain my point of view about a topic, then I explain why and I add some examples to make it clear.At this point, someone expresses their idea.Some people share their thoughts clearly (they rarely add proofs to validate their theories. I am not asking them to do it, I‚Äôd like them to, but I understand it may be too much for the internet) end up saying ‚Äúeveryone thinks differently‚Äù. And that‚Äôs all. Peacefully. But this is a rare situation. Only a small percentage of people is like that.The vast majority of people tells their idea as the only truth. Then shares no proofs, no examples to sustain their thesis.At this point I usually tell them I understand their point and I explain my precise doubts about it. Then I formulate an antithesis to their thesis and answers to all the points they talked about in their thesis.And at this very point they change the subject of the discussion and claim I said something different to what I really said. They made up things I didn‚Äôt say at all. So I explain again my point, I make it easier to understand eventually and I also repeat the exact words I said before.In the end, when they don‚Äôt know what to say, they end up attacking me personally or making fun of me (They use to take a look at my profile to collect few personal informations that lead them to nothing relevant to the topic).Clearly logic isn‚Äôt the right way to communicate on the internet.Too many people get mad, they start insulting me and assume I am a selfish riot (especially if they‚Äôre over 35 years old).But I don‚Äôt understand why a conversation should always end up with people insulting each other.In the end, is there a way to make assumptions without provoking anger in these individuals?If you have the same problem, please let me know",Why do people always misunderstand what I say?,hello everyone i‚Äôd like to know your opinion about a situation i came across too many time sometimes when i am bored i like to express my opinion about various topic on the internet i always start with a ‚Äúthesis‚Äù i am never aggressive a i enjoy sharing idea with other people i explain my point of view about a topic then i explain why and i add some example to make it clear at this point someone express their idea some people share their thought clearly they rarely add proof to validate their theory i am not asking them to do it i‚Äôd like them to but i understand it may be too much for the internet end up saying ‚Äúeveryone think differently‚Äù and that‚Äôs all peacefully but this is a rare situation only a small percentage of people is like that the vast majority of people tell their idea a the only truth then share no proof no example to sustain their thesis at this point i usually tell them i understand their point and i explain my precise doubt about it then i formulate an antithesis to their thesis and answer to all the point they talked about in their thesis and at this very point they change the subject of the discussion and claim i said something different to what i really said they made up thing i didn‚Äôt say at all so i explain again my point i make it easier to understand eventually and i also repeat the exact word i said before in the end when they don‚Äôt know what to say they end up attacking me personally or making fun of me they use to take a look at my profile to collect few personal information that lead them to nothing relevant to the topic clearly logic isn‚Äôt the right way to communicate on the internet too many people get mad they start insulting me and assume i am a selfish riot especially if they‚Äôre over 35 year old but i don‚Äôt understand why a conversation should always end up with people insulting each other in the end is there a way to make assumption without provoking anger in these individual if you have the same problem please let me knowwhy do people always misunderstand what i say,2035,386,0.09,0.12,0.79,0.6797

3126,0,"**Questions:**  **My mom...****I believe she is an unhealthy INFJ representation. But does it sound like, if nothing else but from your guys intuition, like I'm the unhealthy INTJ one here? Am I really wrong or deluding myself, or does it sound like I'm coming from a genuine place? What are your guys' thoughts?**  **And while at it, does anyone have any advice on how I could better deal with my mom?**  I'm sorry, this is REALLY long, but bare with me if you're willing.You'll be missing a lot more long-story context and insight, as our lives are in a very uniquely bad place, but I'm sure an answer should still be possible.As a side note; We all are depressed due to our situation, which of course affects a lot of our feelings and behavior, so I'm not surprised some or all of us don't always act our best. But some of us feel like they're trying a lot harder than others.  &amp;#x200B;**So I have my mom, INFJ, who I don't really get along with.** We used to when I was younger, but not so much anymore. She may not know what feelings of resentment I truly harbor towards her for many of her past actions, because our 'getting along' these days is really just surface level, at least from my perspective, and I don't bother talking to her about my emotions or perspectives on anything as she's never willing to hear them out without getting angry and defensive.She always thinks anything anyone says or does with her even slightly involved is a personal attack, even when it's quite clearly coming from a place of communicational effort or constructive criticism/advice. Doesn't even have to be direct, just if it involves her in ANY way, she will find a way to feel upset over it. This is why I don't get along with her.My brothers are all on her side, and fail to notice her hypocritical and self-serving behaviors, nor do they realize what bad mental effect it's had on them that are caused by them either. She's not a bad person, or even necessarily selfish, but she just seems to me to be VERY misguided. She projects her insecurities onto others without ever even realizing it, she tries to control everything and everyone and doesn't let us be independent, and she won't listen to anyone who tries to point these traits out in her. And since I can't **recite every exact word or succession of events to a T in a past conversation of any given time** like she wants if I'm going to even try pointing out the way I feel, with or without actually trying to direct criticism towards her, I have zero advantage.For as analyzing and self-critical as she is, she just doesn't seem to get this. The ways she's critical of others is not fair, but the way she criticizes herself isn't fair either I guess.&amp;#x200B;She refuses to ever believe she's wrong, and that statement is one I actually DO know for a fact and can say without ANY doubt. Even she'd admit to that. Doesn't stop her from not realizing how many times she's close-minded and projective, though. She just needs to see others' perspectives and realize that everyone does not think or communicate in the same ways and styles that she does, but she clearly has MUCH trouble with this.  Which is fine, if she'd listen to advice. But she doesn't listen to advice even in day to day life.  She always thinks her way is the only way, essentially, and claims that because she's older she's 100% always the one that's more experienced and therefore always the 100% right one with no faults in her methods.  Not playing into consideration that I'm an independent 22 year old whether she likes it or not and that I AM actually intelligent (which she says I am but doesn't TREAT me or any of my siblings like we are) and I DO actually understand things even with how deprived I've been from life experiences, and I DO have a good sense of intuition and experience and know right from wrong and how to judge character correctly  Hell, when I've talked about others before and got her advice on it, she's even affirmed my suspicions to be correct, so you'd think she'd know this about me. Doesn't matter what experiences she has with me though, she only seems to remember and think about me what she wants to remember and think about me. Only sees it from her perspective and never considers anything else.  Since none of my family ever trust in my perspectives though *(we're all very stubborn and I'll admit I'm stubborn to taking in others views too, but I'm not proud of it and that wasn't always the case, just began to be a lot more so as I learned that they don't listen to anyone else but themselves and I have a hard time healthily dealing with that all cooped up in one house with no escape for so many years)*, I have a lot of self-doubt.  Her actions have broken down much of my confidence/self-esteem/trust in myself. So even though I wholeheartedly believe that I see this stuff in her, I know no one else in the family would believe me or even just stop and consider for a moment that I may be on to something and that I actually have reason to believe what I do, and that makes it so I can't help but wonder if maybe I'm deluding myself about this and I am genuinely wrong. Or if I'm somehow not understanding or seeing from the right perspective(s) on this.  &amp;#x200B;I love her, I don't like not having a good relationship with her - ESPECIALLY when I'm forced to keep it so private so that I have to fake pleasantness with her - But I absolutely refuse to give in to her whims when I feel she is being completely unreasonable and I DON'T want to encourage that, and she doesn't let either of us heal from this or work things out.Which is a huge problem, since every advice ever about dealing with INFJs and issues/arguments that I can find tells me to essentially stroke their ego and just agree that they're right, and no one gets that I don't want to do something like that when it serves NO ONE higher good and will just make that person and their life/relationships worse for them and everyone else involved if they keep on that road.  And I've already done enough of that in my younger years. I used to side with her on things so much, but that's because I genuinely saw her as right for most of it (which I'm not as sure about now that I'm much older and have gained a lot more perspective and understanding of psyche and relationship problems).  Then she either got worse; or I had more insight and understood better the circumstances and realized that she wasn't right in everything, and I began to feel less and less right consoling her with zero critical advice involved on the matter that I knew I *should've* been giving.Then it came to a point where she just stopped being open to critical advice altogether, and instead of becoming sad or upset with herself which at least allowed her to reflect and better herself based on what others and herself thought, she became closed off from hearing what anyone else has to say and now she just doesn't budge at all, and she's not willing to improve because it seems to me she doesn't think she has anything to improve *on* \- At least not if the advice comes from anyone else's brain or mouth.Which is why I feel like I'm partially to blame for leading her in more recent years TO be this bad; To not take responsibility for her downfalls or to be more open-minded of others' perspectives and feelings and whatnot. And I don't know how to undo it, or if I'm even seeing this right at all, or how to deal with it and fix things.  Worst of all, her bad and stubborn behavior and all the trauma I carry with it brings out the worst in me, and I absolutely can't stand it. Since we both fight just as hard back as the other, and we both feel pain/upset/resentment, it's just an endless and vastly damaging cycle that really only gets worse as time goes on.    **I feel guilty** and overly stubborn for me thinking all of this, but at the same time, my heart tells me I'm right, that I KNOW I'm right, y'know? But since I have no means of talking it through with anyone, I'm just constantly stuck, and with nothing else but my own internal battles of whether I'm being fair or not in this.  I know this is what I've experienced... And if I'm not right, then there is even more of a lack of understanding between us than I thought.  No matter how much I reassure myself on my experiences, why does their opinion still make me question if I'm not right on this one? It seriously peeves me.I mean, I have always had every other person in the world pegged for their character. I can see right through people - I have great intuition and I've learned how to easily identify people by recognizing patterns.   I KNOW when someone has an unhealthy mentality, when they're being critical or manipulative or self-serving, when they're projecting. I've DEALT with people EXACTLY and very obviously with those issues, and it's caused me a lot of damage in the past.Why would a person I know the BEST be any different? Let alone LESS likely for me to be correct on?",Unhealthy relationship with INFJ mom - Help?!,question my mom i believe she is an unhealthy infj representation but doe it sound like if nothing else

3139,0,"The current belief for most people is that AI will actually replace us and become in a way separated from us. But in fact, I believe artificial intelligence allows us to understand intelligence, thinking,  ideas, creativity, so we as humans. So basically, if we can understand how to develop and analyze artificial intelligence, we analyze ourselves and discover an opening towards our own progress as an individual. However progress takes a different definition here, because we are not really in fact progressing,  we are just more and more revealing ourselves to us by manifesting ourselves throughout it. Artificial intelligence therefore becomes an opening towards us, a deeper insight towards who we are and who we can become, which is ourselves. By creating artificial intelligence, we create the self of tomorrow. Our future, but still our us from today that haven't been manifesting. What we do is constantly becoming ourselves. Everything comes from inside of us and then goes outside of us. Everything exists and is waiting to be manifested.  Theory related to quantum physics but also being and time by Heidegger and it also illustrates the theory of the game of life when we apply it to one individual. In that case, living well and living fully and becoming more and more yourself would be continually making choices that opens up possibilities for even more choices and options.  So always looking for the optimal option that makes you less constrained.  That's a bit like Ai works and we should definitely take example from that.

Although I'm very antisocial and introverted, the very few people I am different with, are first degree family members (4), 3-4 friends, the occasional girlfriend and thats it! By different, I mean a little more talkative, i still don't share anything on my personal life, thoughts, events until asked to.

3182,0,"So I‚Äôm in my last year of high school, and given the current circumstances (the fact I‚Äôm likely to not have to take my final tests and will instead simply be given a grade) I‚Äôve found myself, aside from the school work I‚Äôve been set online - of which there is not tons - and a few video calls, I‚Äôve found myself doing a few things and I‚Äôm wondering if any of you feel the same. Okay so firstly I would like to say that these things have been constant ‚Äòhabits‚Äô of mine for a long time and I have always found myself doing these things, it is just that now this mindset of mine has really taken over everything else I thought about.Given the nature of lockdowns that of course means home study for me, as well as a lot of free time. The problem for me is that I have found myself to be somewhat of a secret geek (I present myself as more of a sports lover etc.) and while I do love soccer I also play many video games and have immersed myself in many media franchises. Think the Batman movies, The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, etc. But, now that I‚Äôm having so much spare time in having many issues sort of balancing things in my life. Last time lockdown happened I though I handled things rather well but now, this being my final year, I feel the stresses of school (which I could easily repress upon returning home) have started to creep into my home and the issue with this is that I don‚Äôt know how to balance it now.I‚Äôve always had this thing (I really hope in not alone in this) where I treat certain leisure activities like a chore and many nights before bed, for many years, I have had a few minutes before actually laying down in which I tell myself ‚Äúokay, so I need to watch [Movie A], some episodes of [SERIES B] start reading [BOOK C] and play a little [VIDEO GAME D].‚Äù However, the issue really is none of this gets done, and especially recently I have found myself waking up around 8-10, laying in bed watching YouTube for a bit, getting watched, finishing school (with a moderate amount of procrastination, however I get done what has to be done and have never handed anything in late or to a bad standard so I don‚Äôt see that as an issue given how uninterested I am in the subjects which I procrastinate from) and only playing ‚ÄòVIDEO GAME D,‚Äô as I called it. Technically I know all I want to do in my heart is play the video game, but the thing is I don‚Äôt.I‚Äôm a bit of a geek as I said, and when I don‚Äôt have immediate problems to sold or a goal to work to (I even have trouble my school work as worth doing as I‚Äôm likely to just be given high grades anyway due to lockdown) these franchises I spoke of begin to take a large precedence over my life, meaning I grow attached to not necessarily a character or anything, but the world itself. That‚Äôs why I find myself on YouTube for so long watching clips from a series or movie I‚Äôve already watched, but then I‚Äôm not willing to go and watch a new movie or series because I don‚Äôt want it to disrupt the relationship I have with these other ones. It‚Äôs weird I know...The most immediate example I can think of is the Witcher. I played the Witcher 3 at the start of first lockdown and loved it (won‚Äôt get too far into that) but after playing it I remembered this game was literally the end of an 8 or 9 book series then 2 games which served as sequels to those books, and I instantly wanted to learn more about the world and the other characters. However I just can‚Äôt push myself to read the books or even watch the Netflix series yet every night I feel stressed out because of the amount of series and franchises I want to learn more about, then I just wake up, work a while to forget about those things and then play a video game and watch YouTube again before repeating the routine.I know this was a long read, but I was just wondering if anyone else does this? Sort of builds up something as simple as a movie, series or franchises you enjoy to the point where, devoid of anything else to do, your mind makes it a chore for you to learn more about the franchise and solidify your enjoyment of it, and you really stress over what you want to ‚Äòlearn‚Äô about it or what you want to watch next. It doesn‚Äôt need to even necessarily be one series either. Like, when I lie in bed before sleep my mind always pesters me about how I want to watch ‚ÄòShutter Island‚Äô and ‚ÄòAmerican Psycho,‚Äô but then I just wake up and... don‚Äôt do it...Please let me know if you feel the same way about overanalysing or building up simple leisure tasks in the absence of an actual larger, short-mid term goal because it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve really been pestered by

The first was Anthony Bourdain who was just a man I deeply admired for his open-mindedness, his intelligence, his genuine desire to leave this world a better place than he came into it etc. His death stung pretty bad for me. The other one was yesterday.[Alexi Laiho passed away yesterday](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/04/entertainment/alexi-laiho-children-of-bodom-death-intl-scli/index.html), and for those who don't know he was the lead singer and lead guitarist of Children of Bodom, and I had a really hard time not bawling. I picked up a guitar when I was thirteen because I'd heard [""In Your Face""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACuk9GgL0uI). Up to that point I'd only been a fan of Nu-Metal (Korn, Slipknot etc.), but then I saw this fucking badass with a cool Yellow and Black Flying V just ripping, and for the first time I knew what being empowered felt like. I'm not going to go over my childhood for the billionth time, but it wasn't good. I genuinely mean this, music (particularly metal) probably kept me from suicide. And some of my most cherished memories from that time was trying to learn the riffs I loved and a lot of solos from Alexi. I've played ever since, wrote and recorded my own music, played a few gigs with a few bands locally, and I wouldn't trade those memories for anything else in the world. I've remained a fan of Metal since then, over half my life at this point, and it's all thanks to Bodom and Alexi in particular.I know that mourning somebody you never met is stupid, but I can't help feeling deep deep sorrow the past couple days.

3217,0,"So recently I thought of a storyline and it‚Äôs just a bit but I realised how much the character reflected my personality. I was originally trying to make her a bit different, but then I just poured all my thoughts in and now it seems like she is just some ungrateful  person. Well here it is:‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm Jenny. I‚Äôm 12 years old, a 7th grader. I have a twin sister, Ellie, who has an utterly different personality as me. We started out as the same cell, but we ended up quite different. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never able to cling onto my hobbies a lot, usually a few months. For example, I loved reading when I was smaller, but I quickly loose interest in a book after I got busy and didn‚Äôt read it for a while. At the summer which I was about to get to 7th grade, I learnt to solve a Rubik‚Äôs cube, which I now call it a 3 by 3. It has become a hobby of mine, and this is my fourth month. Pulling down my times are so satisfying. ‚ÄúI have mild signs of social anxiety. I never really have any people who I could feel comfortable with, and I worry a lot if there are no responses after I say something, even if it‚Äôs just me and my mum, sometimes my sister.‚ÄúIt was until my crush came. It was my first time in a mixed school, so I had a rather different approach towards boys. I found him attractive at first, then his laugh, his voice and his ways sunk into my heart. I confirmed that I had a crush on him and would often get jealous or upset when the hot and cute girls went up to him to have some fun or just talk. I would try them by approaching them, but I got scared and turned away. When I asked my crush on purpose what the next class was, his smile faded away, and he looked down at me (I‚Äôm not even 5 feet yet, you see) in a serious way, looking straight into my eyes. My heart beat faster and I felt a sensation in my chest that could not be let down. But then I squeaked a thanks and I was very embarrassed. It was just too awkward. I hurried away.‚ÄúI had gone through obsession, and I knew it was all just a crush and it would be over in no time. Surely, after two months, I heard my mother say that the middle school I was in had fairly unsatisfying results for public exams, and that was the only school that accepted me back in July. No other better school would do more on that waiting list that has never been my turn. I decided I was going to find better opportunities. I developed a thought to go to UK for boarding school. All my thoughts were on it. I decided to give up my crush to chase my dreams. ‚ÄúBut too much was holding me back. My jaws were small but my teeth were as usual, all those permanent teeth couldn‚Äôt possibly fit in my mouth. I had to get dental treatment like braces, which if I was lucky would take 18 months, but it may last up to 4 years, and there may still be plenty of follow-ups later on. With my parents not in the country, I couldn‚Äôt possibly go to the UK to get braces without a lot of trouble and expenses.‚ÄúThis reminded me of another bothersome situation. Boarding school along with tuition fees were very expensive. Middle class families couldn‚Äôt possibly afford it. The family couldn‚Äôt just spend 10% of their monthly income on these fees when I could just continue living my life.‚ÄùI stopped here. Is Jenny being ambitious and mature, or is she just greedy and ungrateful?",I‚Äôm confused and messed up,so recently i thought of a storyline and it‚Äôs just a bit but i realised how much the character reflected my personality i wa originally trying to make her a bit different but then i just poured all my thought in and now it seems like she is just some ungrateful person well here it is ‚Äúhello i‚Äôm jenny i‚Äôm 12 year old a 7th grader i have a twin sister ellie who ha an utterly different personality a me we started out a the same cell but we ended up quite different ‚Äúi‚Äôm never able to cling onto my hobby a lot usually a few month for example i loved reading when i wa smaller but i quickly loose interest in a book after i got busy and didn‚Äôt read it for a while at the summer which i wa about to get to 7th grade i learnt to solve a rubik‚Äôs cube which i now call it a 3 by 3 it ha become a hobby of mine and this is my fourth month pulling down my time are so satisfying ‚Äúi have mild sign of social anxiety i never really have any people who i could feel comfortable with and i worry a lot if there are no response after i say something even if it‚Äôs just me and my mum sometimes my sister ‚Äúit wa until my crush came it wa my first time in a mixed school so i had a rather different approach towards boy i found him attractive at first then his laugh his voice and his way sunk into my heart i confirmed that i had a crush on him and would often get jealous or upset when the hot and cute girl went up to him to have some fun or just talk i would try them by approaching them but i got scared and turned away when i asked my crush on purpose what the next class wa his smile faded away and he looked down at me i‚Äôm not even 5 foot yet you see in a serious way looking straight into my eye my heart beat faster and i felt a sensation in my chest that could not be let down but then i squeaked a thanks and i wa very embarrassed it wa just too awkward i hurried away ‚Äúi had gone through obsession and i knew it wa all just a crush and it would be over in no time surely after two month i heard my mother say that the middle school i wa in had fairly unsatisfying result for public exam and that wa the only school that accepted me back in july no other better school would do more on that waiting list that ha never been my turn i decided i wa going to find better opportunity i developed a thought to go to uk for boarding school all my thought were on it i decided to give up my crush to chase my dream ‚Äúbut too much wa holding me back my jaw were small but my teeth were a usual all those permanent teeth couldn‚Äôt possibly fit in my mouth i had to get dental treatment like brace which if i wa lucky would take 18 month but it may last up to 4 year and there may still be plenty of follow ups later on with my parent not in the country i couldn‚Äôt possibly go to the uk to get brace without a lot of trouble and expense ‚Äúthis reminded me of another bothersome situation boarding school along with tuition fee were very expensive middle class family couldn‚Äôt possibly afford it the family couldn‚Äôt just spend 10 of their monthly income on these fee when i could just continue living my life ‚Äùi stopped here is jenny being ambitious and mature or is she just greedy and ungrateful i‚Äôm confused and messed up,3206,655,0.102,0.134,0.763,0.9885

3269,0,"This is the last part of my IN - hunter-gatherer comparison.  Let me know what you think of it.   I have been arguing that neurodiverse people have ancient hunter-gatherer minds living in a farmer society. Many aspects of neurodiversity can be understood from this alone, e.g. that farmer-herder types make up well 75% of the population, The remaining 25% make up hunter-gatherer types, who are generally less attuned to social norms and less conformist. It's also estimated that up to 25% of the population are neurodiverse. A lot of aspects of neurodiversity often get ‚Äúpathologized‚Äù when we are really only dealing with our evolutionary programme here: minds that worked well for millennia in hunter-gatherer societies, but that often function poorly in our modern society when it comes to ‚Äúrote farmer tasks‚Äù. A lot of neurodiverse people struggle in school (rote learning) and 9-5 routine ‚Äúfarmer‚Äù jobs. As Thom Hartmann (who discovered the link between hunting and ADHD) says, hunter-types in offices are probably the reason why coffee is the number one drink in the world.Here is an overview of evolutionary types (with their respective temperament):&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/t9dj57kh0a961.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62fa9bcad2d0baef10dc42388b34659567e5f946These types may be somewhat mixed, but much less so than expected due to a phenomenon called ‚Äúassortative mating‚Äù. Assortative mating aligns nicely with these four types (i.e. farmer types having a preference for farmer type mates, etc.)Imagine putting a hunter-gatherer into a farmer-herder society. The first thing that will probably happen is some kind of pathology, starting with food-allergies (wheat and dairy), and other problems like irritable bowel syndrome, ¬†leaky-gut syndrome and hypothyroidism. Hunter-gatherers are not adapted to a farmer diet and so the body ‚Äúmalfunctions‚Äù and pathologies arise. Up to 70% of children with ASD are reported to have gastrointestinal problems. Of course, they don‚Äôt have ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù hunter-gatherer bodies, as their hunter-gatherer ancestors probably integrated into farmer societies centuries ago. So, they do have the ability to digest ‚Äúfarmer‚Äù food, but it may be less developed than in farmer types.Moreover, a lot of these problems may also be related to higher stress levels. Having a hunter-gatherer mind that is not entirely adapted to a farmer society is bound to cause increased stress levels. There is a well-known correlation between high cortisol and alcoholism and I bet a lot of hunter-gatherer type people use alcohol for self-medication. High alcohol use can also be found in real hunter-gatherer populations who are assimilated into our civilisation: Native Americans, Nunavik and Australian Aborigines. Among neurodiverse young people with ADHD show the highest risk of addiction with more than 25% of adolescent substance use having ADHD. And this number pales in comparison to online and gaming addiction:*A 2-year prospective study found that adolescents diagnosed as ADHD were the most likely to be addicted to the Internet than other psychiatric symptoms such as hostility and social phobia*¬†([source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5517818/%23:~:text%3DA%25202%252Dyear%2520prospective%2520study,and%2520social%2520phobia%2520%255B5%255D.&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1609751463130000&amp;usg=AOvVaw11Ieozk_1Zwuj8-14YbdGc)).Where does the social anxiety and hostility that we frequently see in neurodiverse people come from? The following lesson from history may give us a clue:*‚Äú\[‚Ä¶\] when the Spanish began their conquest of South America, one of their earliest settlements was at the site of modern Buenos Aires. The settlement was a colonial failure and soon abandoned because the local hunter-gatherers refused to work for the Spanish, even under extreme duress. When the Spanish ventured farther inland and encountered agriculturalists in Paraguay, they easily subjugated the local people by conquering and replacing the aristocracy \[‚Ä¶\]‚Äù (*from: William von Hippel¬†*The Social Leap)*  What was the difference between the hunter-gatherer and agricultural societies the Spanish met? Agricultural societies are hierarchically structured. Conformism is an absolute must in order to avoid hierarchical conflicts. The Paraguayans agriculturalists, therefore, didn‚Äôt find it too hard to live under Spanish domination (after some initial resistance). However, the egalitarian hunter-gatherers could never have lived as slaves for the Spanish.Having egalitarian hunter-gatherer minds neurodiverse people find it hard to fit into social hierarchies. Pair this with an aversion to 9-5 routine work and it is easy to understand why so many people with ADHD (e.g. Richard Branson) drop out of school and become self-employed and entrepreneurs. Social anxiety and hostility are also consequences of the egalitarian mindset. Imagine the ADHD kid who is both aggressive towards peers and teachers and fearful at the same time. This is not proactive aggression, it is clearly reactive aggression ¬†My guess is that most children who develop oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) are hunter-type children.To sum up, a host of phenomena seen in neurodiverse children can be understood as them not living in the right kind of environment and are therefore evolutionary mismatches. As I have argued before pattern-seeking cognition and hypersensitivity are among these, as are:* Social anxiety* Defiant behavior (seemingly ‚Äúantisocial‚Äù behavior)* Depression* Substance use* Online and gaming addiction",INTJ and hunter-gatherers: part III - difficulties adapting to a ‚Äúfarmer‚Äù society,this is the last part of my in hunter gatherer comparison let me know what you think of it i have been arguing that neurodiverse people have ancient hunter gatherer mind living in a farmer society many aspect of neurodiversity can be understood from this alone e g that farmer herder type make up well 75 of the population the remaining 25 make up hunter gatherer type who are generally le attuned to social norm and le conformist it s also estimated that up to 25 of the population are neurodiverse a lot of aspect of neurodiversity often get ‚Äúpathologized‚Äù when we are really only dealing with our evolutionary programme here mind that worked well for millennium in hunter gatherer society but that often function poorly in our modern society when it come to ‚Äúrote farmer tasks‚Äù a lot of neurodiverse people struggle in school rote learning and 9 5 routine ‚Äúfarmer‚Äù job a thom hartmann who discovered the link between hunting and adhd say hunter type in office are probably the reason why coffee is the number one drink in the world here is an overview of evolutionary type with their respective temperament amp x200b,1119,196,0.032,0.04,0.927,0.1717

3279,0,"First things first, I love INTJs. My father is one, and we have an amazing relationship. I can come to him with any problem and he will solve it, or attempt to. I find you guys wise, intelligent, and capable individuals. But my observations of him and other INTJs have raised concerns about their supposed compatibility with my type. First. The Fe blindness. It coupled with the Te preference means that I can only express myself in direct terms, and things like body language and subtle expressions seem to go completely unnoticed. I could have the largest frown on my face, and completely reserved body language, and answer shortly, and my INTJ father would still go on without a clue. I'm a woman and while I had no problem being a brash and outspoken teenager, I've become much more reserved and nuanced in my communication. I don't want to have to constantly voice my feelings, and would rather be read via body language. My father will tell me that he knows how I feel and then demonstrate little actual empathy. Maybe he does on a cognitive level, but it doesn't seem he really ""feel"" it. As well, I really aspire for a ""happy home"" in married life. Fe users have a knack for curating a mood and bringing people together as a group. INTJs seem disinterested in these things. And while I enjoy a close relationship with my father, my ISTP brother receives little of the same effort and, honestly, love, that I do (As he doesn't conform to Te achievements, he is seen as somewhat useless by my father). It's completely unequal. As an Fi user, I know the harsh truth that we play favorites. But I would hate to put children in a similarly unfair situation. I would hate to be the only one taking initiative with family things or children (my father for example has never changed a diaper in his life...a moment of silence for my poor mom). I also wonder how well two Fi users could actually work in a relationship. My Fi is intense, and something I usually feel the need to downplay. Would dating an Fi user be ""too much""? Would it feel like joint insanity? I briefly dated an INFP, and it was like all he saw of me was a smokescreen to project his own fantasy reality onto. I disliked this a lot. As well, there's an INTJ who is currently pursuing me despite me having told him I wanted to be friends (in multiple ways/nuance). It seems he isn't able to accept it. His Ni-Te has locked onto me as a ""goal"" and I have become a pursuit for him. Not only is it somewhat dehumanizing to be a ""prize"", it's selfish in that his feelings are the only thing that seem to matter in this situation. He will often vent to me but doesn't seems to notice that I never do the same. And he just. Keeps. Pursuing. It puts me in the uncomfortable situation of having to be blunter and blunter and feeling quite mean for it. I really believe ENFP women can appear as manic pixie dream girls, but we aren't a prize or level to beat. Where is the consideration for our feelings? Please let me know your thoughts, and I truly hope this doesn't come across as bashing. I am just genuinely curious as to how this compatibility could have downfalls in this regard, away from the stereotypes. I would love to hear some real life experience, especially with Fi-Fi relationships, from you! I know some of this could be individual/off mark.

3292,0,"I am a female (18) who recently took the Myer Briggs test and after reading the description for INTJ I felt understood for the first time ever. Everything makes sense now and I know why I am the way I am. I am wondering if anyone else prior to finding out they are an INTj were constantly struggling to play the ""social game"" but played it anyways? I am now realizing that I had been constantly exhausting myself trying to be bubbly, charismatic, and impressionable like my female counterparts because I had observed them, and saw that acting this way granted them male attention, free stuff, access to partys and groups groups etc ( I now realize that I shouldn't force myself to act this way anymore because it was so forced and not myself)I read that INTj's are most attractive when they are not trying to be and when they are putting their energy into their passions. I find this to be very true, but at the same time it is really hard for me to put effort into my passions, and try to pursue people at the same time. I think it can be hard as a female INTJ because men my age like women who give them attention in a stupid flirty way. I am passionate, just in a more intellectual way if that makes sense? I have such a hard time playing along with traditional dating rituals, I get such a bad ick from it, which is why I normally resort to be-friending men and becoming platonically close before pursuing them romantically.

She texted me back basically trying to give her reasoning for her emotions and today I met up with her and that'll be the following paragraphs.I had her come over to my house for some coffee and to talk. And it turns out she was sexually assaulted. I'm not going to go into detail as it's unnecessary to the rest of this post, but in her mind I violated a sense of trust she had given me without me knowing. This is going to sound like me trying to advertise that I'm a good guy, but she said certain actions of mine and certain conversations lulled her emotionally into giving more trust than she usually does to men (translation: she idealized me and when I didn't live up to the ideal she built in her head, she felt betrayed).So I just apologized, assured her that I don't think sexual assault is an non-issue and if I see it occurring I'll do everything in my power to stop it. Some other stuff happened. She then asked why I never asked her out. I told her she never gave me indication that she liked me in that way. She then said she flirted with me at least a few times a week. I mentioned this in the previous post, but she would do things like giggle at something I said, say something vaguely insulting like ""that's dumb"" or ""you're so extra"" (yeah I cringed at typing that just as much as you did reading it) and then lightly slap my arm. That's flirting? Really? Is that other INTJs experience with it. It made me look back and that's not the first time I've ever been flirted with like that, and honestly it seems like the exclusive way I get flirted with. Not sure why women who are interested in me want to knock me down a peg as well, but it is what it is. We had a conversation where I said I'm not going to date her, partially because I don't want to be with someone that idealizes me, I'd like to still be seen as a human being in my relationships. But, I'm also moving halfway across the country in 2 weeks and I have no faith she could handle an LDR or that I'd want to invest in an LDR for any significant amount of time. So, that's the conclusion of that. Learned a bit more about emotions so it wasn't all for naught.

3330,0,"Hi, 25y INTJ male (although I sometimes identify as ENTJ and a little bit INTP). One of my goals for this year is to be more passionate, less rigid and calculated. The past years I've kinda been struggling romantically and I want to change that. My last relationship (which was with an ENFP) ended because I was too rigid and didn't seem like I cared that much about her. Now there's this girl who's been a total crush of mine for the last two years. I asked her on a date once, we went out and then nothing happened (I didn't insist either so I don't know exactly that happened there). Anyway, from what she told me then, she was (and seems like it) an INFJ, if that says anything. We keep seeing each other from time to time because we have mutual friends. She actually initiated some hangouts lately. Anyway, I went to her place a week ago with some friends, had fun, but at one point she mentioned so randomly that she had sex with her manager (that kinda crushed me a little, but on the other hand, she's a free person, we're not together...but why would she mention that?). And later on we started a heated argument about how, judging by our astrological signs, we aren't compatible. (She doesn't believe in that at all though). We were both pretty drunk so I don't remember much. Two days later, I went to a New Year's party with mutual friends of hers and she came there as well (with another guy...who might've only been a friend, because they seemed close but not really intimate). Funny thing is... another guy there was a Tarot reader and I asked him about my love life in 2021 (I don't believe in this stuff and he didn't know me). What's funny is that he guessed that I've been involved with another person for the past years and that we haven't actually done anything because I am too cold and the other person has past relationship issues holding her back. But that there is a lot of passion from my end and some passion from her end and that we will try to resolve this in 2021. At this point, the girl I liked (who had been paying attention) pointed out that she doesn't believe in Tarot but that I am indeed too cold with women. Now... do you think that Tarot guy was right? Could there be some passion from her end as well? I can usually read other people decently, but I can't read her at all. I don't even know what to do in this situation. Should I drop her completely and move on with my life? Should I try to pursue her somehow? But I am indeed too rigid now, I don't know how to be more passionate with her or flirt with her. TLDR: I started this text trying to find out how to develop my emotions, but I ended up writing a lot more about my connection to this INFJ girl.

3351,0,"Hello! I find it really difficult to make friends with women, and find myself in a far more comfortable state when hanging out with guys. In high school, up to the age of about 16, pretty much all my friends were girls and I was part of the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù group, without sounding pretentious. However, when I moved into sixth form, I dragged away from this group and sort of became a lone wolf, mainly interacting with a group of boys who soon became my closest friends. 4 years later, I have a boyfriend of 2 years who I met at university, and I pretty much only have one female friend, who was my best friend in my boarding house. She‚Äôs a hyper-intelligent ENF-P (which may surprise people), and one of the most interesting people I know to talk to.Problem is, now I genuinely struggle with how to act around girls who aren‚Äôt her. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but there‚Äôs a level of anxiety that I don‚Äôt know how to explain when I‚Äôm confronted with a group of girls. For example, there‚Äôs a few girls that my boyfriend was friends with a school, and so occasionally I‚Äôll meet them in group meet-ups or whatever. If left alone with them, I don‚Äôt struggle to have conversation, but I find myself pretending to be kinda stupid, and acting way more girly than I actually am around them.A specific example is when I went to a poker night with a group of my boyfriends school friends. Now, in all fairness, my boyfriend + I really enjoy our poker, and take it quite seriously outside of social poker nights, so of course we‚Äôre going to know the basic strategy better than a bunch of people who barely play the game. The boys who we were playing with also did not know much basic strategy, but I think because they thought it was a ‚Äúcool‚Äù activity, they took it more seriously than the girls. I found the girls were very loud despite acting extremely stupidly during the game, and I‚Äôd really struggle to make conversation with them, because I just felt we were way to different. Then the self-analytics dropped in. I started thinking that maybe I‚Äôm just not ‚Äúcool‚Äù enough to get along with these girls, and that‚Äôs why I dislike them - because I find them intimidating or threatening because of their femininity ?When I‚Äôm in a group of girls with no boys there, I struggle the most. I find that they‚Äôre often talking over eachother, and laughing wildly at shit that I‚Äôd just smile at. In my mind, they seem to be competing to be the biggest personality in the room. I end up feeling like shit because I‚Äôm not loud enough or comfortable enough to compete with them, as their confidence is all they need to guide them through to social success.With a group of boys, I generally feel far more comfortable. I don‚Äôt feel the need to impress them, I will crack a joke and not expect a gaggle of laughter to follow, and I can be quiet if I want to. I can steer the conversation to something I find interesting with general ease, as they seem far more open to someone dropping an unrelated topic into the mix. Basically, I‚Äôm really struggling to work out whether the reason I have issues becoming friends with girls is one of the following:1) I am incompatible for friendship with most women due to my personality type. There are women out there I would get along with but I just havnt found them yet.2) I feel intimidated/threatened by them in a social setting, and therefore, don‚Äôt even try to make friends with them in the first place and villainize them 3) Something elseWould really appreciate any other female INTJs to share their similar experiences with me, and any INTJs generally to try and work this out for me.Thank you !",Fellow females - struggle with making friends with females ?,hello i find it really difficult to make friend with woman and find myself in a far more comfortable state when hanging out with guy in high school up to the age of about 16 pretty much all my friend were girl and i wa part of the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù group without sounding pretentious however when i moved into sixth form i dragged away from this group and sort of became a lone wolf mainly interacting with a group of boy who soon became my closest friend 4 year later i have a boyfriend of 2 year who i met at university and i pretty much only have one female friend who wa my best friend in my boarding house she‚Äôs a hyper intelligent enf p which may surprise people and one of the most interesting people i know to talk to problem is now i genuinely struggle with how to act around girl who aren‚Äôt her i don‚Äôt know what it is but there‚Äôs a level of anxiety that i don‚Äôt know how to explain when i‚Äôm confronted with a group of girl for example there‚Äôs a few girl that my boyfriend wa friend with a school and so occasionally i‚Äôll meet them in group meet ups or whatever if left alone with them i don‚Äôt struggle to have conversation but i find myself pretending to be kinda stupid and acting way more girly than i actually am around them a specific example is when i went to a poker night with a group of my boyfriend school friend now in all fairness my boyfriend i really enjoy our poker and take it quite seriously outside of social poker night so of course we‚Äôre going to know the basic strategy better than a bunch of people who barely play the game the boy who we were playing with also did not know much basic strategy but i think because they thought it wa a ‚Äúcool‚Äù activity they took it more seriously than the girl i found the girl were very loud despite acting extremely stupidly during the game and i‚Äôd really struggle to make conversation with them because i just felt we were way to different then the self analytics dropped in i started that maybe i‚Äôm just not ‚Äúcool‚Äù enough to get along with these girl and that‚Äôs why i dislike them because i find them intimidating or threatening because of their femininity when i‚Äôm in a group of girl with no boy there i struggle the most i find that they‚Äôre often talking over eachother and laughing wildly at shit that i‚Äôd just smile at in my mind they seem to be competing to be the biggest personality in the room i end up like shit because i‚Äôm not loud enough or comfortable enough to compete with them a their confidence is all they need to guide them through to social success with a group of boy i generally feel far more comfortable i don‚Äôt feel the need to impress them i will crack a joke and not expect a gaggle of laughter to follow and i can be quiet if i want to i can steer the conversation to something i find interesting with general ease a they seem far more open to someone dropping an unrelated topic into the mix basically i‚Äôm really struggling to work out whether the reason i have issue becoming friend with girl is one of the following 1 i am incompatible for friendship with most woman due to my personality type there are woman out there i would get along with but i just havnt found them yet 2 i feel intimidated threatened by them in a social setting and therefore don‚Äôt even try to make friend with them in the first place and villainize them 3 something elsewould really appreciate any other female s to share their similar experience with me and any s generally to try and work this out for me thank you fellow female struggle with making friend with female,3534,673,0.09,0.158,0.752,0.9952

3372,0,"I know that family is important and that family should help each other out. I've been relatively greedy(for a lack of better term) for a big part of my life. By that, I mean that I've always kept to myself. I didn't really want to share toys with other kids(only with close friends). When I bought food or candy, I wanted to keep it to myself, hide it and not share it, because I didn‚Äôt want to run out of them fast. Whenever I‚Äôd not share something I was called selfish, and I can‚Äôt blame them. Whenever I now get asked to do something, like installing lamps, mow the grass, or construct furniture, etc... I tend to delay it for a long time. I mean, I happen to do this only to ‚Äòsome‚Äô family members; mainly my mother, sister and father. I tend to be more willing to help out my brothers more, and I tend to become lazy when I have to help out my mother, sister and father. I keep telling them I‚Äôll do the task, but end up being lazy and only do it when they become adamant. I tend to be more willing to help out my close friends more than my own family members. I occasionally talk to friends in the middle of the night, and my mother &amp; sister tell me to quiet it down. Sometimes I forget to do it. I know that with Fi, I can have a tendency to only care about my issues.‚ÄúWhenever you ask us to do something, we always help you out. We stop our tasks to help you out, while you don‚Äôt do the same. We asked you to stop talking in the night, but you seem to prioritize your friends above your family members, which is selfish.‚Äù I‚Äôm from a culture where family is very important, but for some reason I don‚Äôt prioritize them. Whenever teens work vacation jobs in my culture, they give a percentage of their money to their parents, because they prioritize their family, while I tend to greedily hoard my money when I make my own money, and barely give anything to my parents.I know that I‚Äôm being selfish. But I‚Äôm upset about something. I‚Äôve always been told to take care of my parents when they get old and to let them move into my house. My plans for the future are to move somewhere else and move on my own. I don‚Äôt like the thought of becoming a nurse to my parents when they get old. I‚Äôm 22, my father is 66 and my mother is 60. So they‚Äôre already pretty old and they‚Äôre going to reach that age pretty fast. They were always out of energy to raise me, and the difference of generational gap was so large, that I couldn‚Äôt relate to them a lot. I feel like they‚Äôre helping me out, so that I‚Äôd take care of them when they get old. I feel like I‚Äôve been put on this world, just to end up being a babysitting nurse. My family constantly mentions what they do for me, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done this and that for you, and you haven‚Äôt done anything back.‚Äù I feel like a debt slave, collecting more debt when I ask them for help.I was poor when I was a child, and my parents used our money to visit our home country several times a year, while they tell me that it‚Äôs expensive too take me with them. I can understand it‚Äôs expensive. But when you get treated like an expensive burden, it doesn‚Äôt make me feel very excited to help them out with things. I felt like I‚Äôm an expensive burden, and yet I have to give it my all and take care of them when they get old. I was upset that they haven‚Äôt taught me any values. So I guess I felt a bit of a burden to help them out. Helping them feels like paying back a loan. While with my friends, they don‚Äô t really expect anything or have big expectations like my own family. So why do you think I prioritize my family members less, while others more, and prioritizing my friends even more? Does any of you here relate, where you don‚Äôt prioritize your family members?

When they got together, he told all of his friends ""I dont love her, she's just easy."" She didn't speak out when she was angry. She didn't push him out of his Si child comfort zone. She let him drink himself stupid every night. She didn't ask to be part of our friend group. She never said more than an ""oh"" when he would post his cat on social media saying ""You're all I need.""Fast forward a year. My boyfriend and I had broken up. My boyfriend asked our friend group to pick a side. Since they all work together, our friend group chose my ex. I was left without friends for a year, because I felt too burned to go trying to meet new people in a town where I dont know anybody but them. It sucked for me, but it is what it is. Hans messaged me and said he still wants to be my friend, but only if I didnt tell anybody. He said he was scared my ex would beat him up. Fair point. Alright.Hans would ask me to hang out, and I'd say okay, only for him to ask me to meet at the end of the road. Once in the car, he would tell me he left his girlfriend in bed. Snuck out and didn't say bye. He continued on, just like every other time I've hung out with him, talking about how much he wants to end the relationship. Said he cheats on her often. I was honest about hoe shitty he is toward her. The next time he asked me to hang out, he pulled the same shit. Just left her in bed like an asshole. She kept calling him asking if he was okay. Hed just let it ring. It was awful. I stopped hanging out with him.Fast forward another year. Two nights ago, he messages me asking me to hang out. Tells me she dumped him hard. Gave him the ol ""its not you, its me."" He starts whining and acting mopey. I obviously don't understand why. Also, good for her!Then he starts moping about how he only has 4 friends and none of them talk. Hello??? Do you remember when you guys all picked sides??? And left me without friends??? None of you checked on me. Am I supposed to feel sorry for you? But I hold my tongue. I tell him I'm busy tonight, but I can hang out tomorrow.

She's trying to get more into music I like (The heavier end of metal, too many subgenres to list) and with metal you kind of have to ramp up to the heavier stuff or you're going to hate it, a lot of it is an acquired taste.Anyways, I gave her a list of bands she should check out on both the lighter and heavier sides of that genre and one of the bands I recommended was [Lorna Shore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig9-a8o2qgU) (if you don't like guttural vocals, you won't like them).Now to the main point finally, she googled a few of the bands and Lorna Shore was one of those ones. Apparently the lead singer was accused of sexual assault (specifically pissing on some chick without consent, which is a crime if true) and was fired from the band for that reason she brought that to my attention and without really thinking about it, my response was apparently not wanted. I said something along the lines of ""Oh, that sucks, he's a great vocalist"" and didn't think much beyond that.She kept the conversation going by asking ""Are you still gonna listen to them?"" I responded ""Yes"". She went on a minor tirade about sexual assault (a lot of the same talking points you can find in any Buzzfeed or Huffpost article on the subject) and my last response was ""I understand if you feel that way, I'll recommend another band. But, you need to understand that the sexual assault and the produced music are two different things to me, but I'll make sure to double check any recommendations for that in the future"" She still won't text me back and I realized that far more often than not, I can separate the art from the artist. Chinatown is one of my favorite movies, I love Kevin Smith and early Tarantino flicks, despite all of them being produced by Harvey Weinstein, I can still watch Chris Benoit matches with my friends who are wrestling fans (not a huge fan, but I like the athleticism on display from a lot of guys).

It does not have a reflection on the intelligence, excellence or will-power of each mbti type. In fact, I believe that it is the individual and not their type that deserves merit for those three things.**A friend's theory of the graph:**""I am saying that if you need more and more things to be satisfied with yourself and your own work, then your production and the quality of your success will be higher and higher. Meaning the higher you go in the pyramid, the more likely you will see those particular types in the elites class. I have conducted a social experiment on this too. I found that when you go to places that involves work and creativity and high IQ you are ""more likely"" to find the types in yellow more often""**My understanding of this graph:**Essentially, the graph is illustrating the *needs* of each type. Why do I know this? Because at the top of the graph is the phrase ""self actualization""&gt;Self-actualization, in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, is the highest level of psychological development where the ""actualization"" of full personal potential is achieved, which occurs usually after basic bodily and ego needs have been fulfilled.The graph is based on that model essentially.

Most of the time it's me trying to help others by making them do the correct things or simply suggesting solutions for them but when they reach a certain level of input (or maybe just too much to take for me), I just ignore them and tell them to mind their own business.Most people assume T as being logical and F as being emotional but I don't think that's necessarily true. You can be reasonable and care for others' emotional values, just like how you can be selfish and manipulative to the system for your own sake. One day I had a small argue with my ENFJ girlfriend. She was simply being sympathetic and my Ni wasn't available that time. I tried to reply her by expressing my emotions (which was lacking in the first place) and suggesting some practical solutions for her (btw this scared the $h!t out of her so I stopped) to keep her company and improve our relationship, but ended up depleting my emotions trying to keep up with hers.After that I noticed I was acting a little selfish asking her to do things for me. It's not like in the unhealthy way but was kind of bothersome, creating some disagreement between us. I think my Te was overloaded because I failed to carry out emotional support that she needed, so my Fi sneaked in trying to boss her around for me. It was one of those weird moments when Te needed to use emotions while Fi wanted to ignore them.Well I still think T is most closely related to logic and F is most closely related to emotion, but now I can kind of see how it can be otherwise. Or maybe it was Te trying to act like Fe, but failed miserably I'm not sure. I don't particularly think my Fi is unhealthy and I don't think I was stressed being in a loop nor a Se grip.Any similar experience with your Te and Fi?",How does your Te vs Fi work?,i feel like i have to choose between improving the system and doing what i like i don t particularly have much personal pereference so usually it s the te that dominates over fi and i m completely happy with it most of the time it s me trying to help others by making them do the correct thing or simply suggesting solution for them but when they reach a certain level of input or maybe just too much to take for me i just ignore them and tell them to mind their own business most people assume t a being logical and f a being emotional but i don t think that s necessarily true you can be reasonable and care for others emotional value just like how you can be selfish and manipulative to the system for your own sake one day i had a small argue with my enfj girlfriend she wa simply being sympathetic and my ni wasn t available that time i tried to reply her by expressing my emotion which wa lacking in the first place and suggesting some practical solution for her btw this scared the h t out of her so i stopped to keep her company and improve our relationship but ended up depleting my emotion trying to keep up with hers after that i noticed i wa acting a little selfish asking her to do thing for me it s not like in the unhealthy way but wa kind of bothersome creating some disagreement between u i think my te wa overloaded because i failed to carry out emotional support that she needed so my fi sneaked in trying to bos her around for me it wa one of those weird moment when te needed to use emotion while fi wanted to ignore them well i still think t is most closely related to logic and f is most closely related to emotion but now i can kind of see how it can be otherwise or maybe it wa te trying to act like fe but failed miserably i m not sure i don t particularly think my fi is unhealthy and i don t think i wa stressed being in a loop nor a se grip any similar experience with your te and fi how doe your te v fi work,1938,392,0.135,0.126,0.739,-0.9215

He mentioned on time that he overthinks a situation he's in, sometimes he freezes because of no idea how to respond or continue a conversation.

3456,0,"I posted this to the Type Me sub but I'm putting it here too in case it resonates with any of you or you see something I'm missing.I'm hoping someone will be willing to help me work through some questions I am having about my personality type. About 12 years ago I took my first test and scored as an INFP. I was in my early teenage years and very wrapped up in feeling different than my peers. I very strongly value authenticity and creativity. My family used to say I was a dreamer, and so I related to the INFP description. However, some things didn't add up. I prefer to frame my thoughts and opinions on logic and facts, not on my feelings. My decisions are almost always based on logical analysis. I can look back on my life and see times when I made an irrational decision and these decisions are embarrassing to me. I have regretted the majority of emotional decisions I have made in my life. Other INFPs I have known have told me that I seem too ""cold"" to be an INFP, as I struggle to be emotionally available or expressive except to people I feel romantic towards. I believe in being true to myself, but I also believe that my beliefs should be evolving based on new information and experiences. I don't like it when people say ""that's just the way I am"".I've known for a while now that I'm probably not an INFP but only a few months ago did I retake the test. I got INTP, which has seemed to suit me better. However, recently I have been thinking perhaps I am actually an INTJ. Here's my reasoning:1. My cognitive functions. I didn't know about cognitive functions until recently and had never taken a test for those until last week. Here's my stack: Ni&gt;Ne&gt;Te=Ti&gt;Fi&gt;Si&gt;Fe&gt;Se2. I love to gather information. I love creating new theories and ideas. But I quickly discard ideas that I can't see an application for. I am more interested in being creative as it applies to the real world and sometimes I find knowledge for knowledge's sake pointless.3. I'm very ambitious but I'm also quite private. I am happy doing my own thing and making stuff happen without needing input from other people (except my husband).4. I fear failure but even more so I fear being incompetent and I find that memories of embarrassing situations stay with me for a very long time. I can vividly recall times where I was embarrassed and I still feel sick thinking about them.5. I find it easy to see how things will play out, which seems to be an INTJ thing.6. I'm extremely critical. I can find a way to make anything better. Editing comes naturally to me, as does writing. I have a particular interest in architecture and interior design, which seems to be a marriage between my problem solving skills and my desire to make things look and feel better.Now some things that don't quite add up...I'm not great at math because I struggle to think linearly. I've got the INTP thing of having a million different ideas and not being able to follow a clear line of reasoning sometimes. I find it incredibly frustrating in conversation when I feel forced to contribute before I've had time to establish a cohesive thought. I think that is one of the reasons I come across as scatter-brained when in reality I'm just trying to sort through a lot of noise. I don't enjoy having a tight schedule but I do love organizing my home.Anyway, hoping for some insight!

To my dad ( Who may be a narcissist), me and my brothers were probably his property. In this quarantine I had to move and live with them again. Let me say, It sucks.They expect me to help with everything but I don't have the will of power. I spend most day depressed on my bedroom because I don't like the hypocrisy. My family calls me selfish. I tried helping them in the beginning of quarantine, yes. But them It was never enough. How about we talking about how your parent skills were never enough?My mother is dead and since she is gone my father become a little better. Anyways, the fact that he has a heart condition ( but he was operated) makes he think that everyone owes he everything. I was trying to do the house chores. But It is never enough, It has to be by the time he wants It. You can imagine how this sucks for an intj that has to be 100  % focused on whatever. Being interrupted ALL the time. To take a coffee, to do some random idiotic thing because he does not want to do by himself.I am on college right now and I can't afford myself. My dad pressures me all the time to finish college quickly. It makes me mad because how do you think If you say something time will spend faster ? Can you just stop annoying me?By the way I am doing better in college now, but my grades were awful in the first year. I lived far away from them but I was depressed. My dad never gave me an opportunity to pursue my studies where I wanted ( he could have). It had always to be like he wanted. Growing up, my family never stimulated hobbies or personal independence, free choices. We were always obligated to do what dad wanted.My brothers don't care too much about It, because anyways they don't think carreer is so important and they don't care about freedom. I feel smothered by having to live other people's schedules. I don't relate to these people, I have nothing in common with them. Family for me is somebody who cares about you and makes you free.I had huge fights with them during this quarantine. I just can't take It anymore. I frequently wonder how my life could have been much better with my parents were different . Family routine sucks, but going to college sucks too. I don't like the city where I study, I wish I could have had the choice to apply to somewhere else. Now my grades are awful and I don't know what to do, I want to cry every time I have to go to college, but I know that If I stop studying now, It will take much longer for me to be able to work.

3478,0,"Just over a year ago, I (ENTP 32F) met an INTJ (35M) through a mutual friend and as expected, we got on like a house on fire. We were casual acquaintances for a while (he was attached) then after he broke up we started texting much more.The main hitch was that we were in different countries - he was in our home country and I was working overseas. About 2 months after we started chatting he wanted more, but for personal reasons that I couldnt bring myself to disclose at that time (a close family member had committed suicide and my family was falling apart in the resulting litigation over his estate) I wasnt emotionally ready for ""more"", so when he asked if I wanted to be more than friends I said no. Unfortunately I was also struggling with a lot of anxiety from the unprocessed grief and in the process I think I might have hurt his feelings / ego / self esteem when I told him I didnt want to be more than friends - it was direct no after a lot of flirting, but we never really discussed why. Spiralling from the anxiety didn't help. Eventually he decided he wanted to be no more than friends and moved on, which I respect, and hes been seeing someone else for about a year. We still text occasionally, but nothing as electric as before - he's clearly much more reserved now, even more so than when we were only casual acquaintances. I dont blame him, but I've always felt a niggling sense of guilt over how I might've made him feel when I declined his overtures. After a lot of work I've gotten much better, and since it's almost the new year I was thinking of texting him to apologise for behaving poorly back then, kind of like to clear out an old debt before the new year, but I dont know if it would be weird given that it's been 1.5 years since he's moved on.Should I still apologise or would it be too late and therefore inappropriate now?P.S. I also plan to go NC from Jan 1st onwards to get over him and move on - it's getting too hard to try and be friends/friendly when the dynamic seems so much less, well, dynamic than what it could be. I'm not sure why on his part (I can only guess hurt, suspicion of motives, respecting his girlfriend, and being careful not to give me the wrong idea), but I'm also too tired of trying to poke around to find out.",Should I apologize now or is it too late?,just over a year ago i entp 32f met an 35m through a mutual friend and a expected we got on like a house on fire we were casual acquaintance for a while he wa attached then after he broke up we started texting much more the main hitch wa that we were in different country he wa in our home country and i wa working overseas about 2 month after we started chatting he wanted more but for personal reason that i couldnt bring myself to disclose at that time a close family member had committed suicide and my family wa falling apart in the resulting litigation over his estate i wasnt emotionally ready for more so when he asked if i wanted to be more than friend i said no unfortunately i wa also struggling with a lot of anxiety from the unprocessed grief and in the process i think i might have hurt his s ego self esteem when i told him i didnt want to be more than friend it wa direct no after a lot of flirting but we never really discussed why spiralling from the anxiety didn t help eventually he decided he wanted to be no more than friend and moved on which i respect and he been seeing someone else for about a year we still text occasionally but nothing a electric a before he s clearly much more reserved now even more so than when we were only casual acquaintance i dont blame him but i ve always felt a niggling sense of guilt over how i might ve made him feel when i declined his overture after a lot of work i ve gotten much better and since it s almost the new year i wa of texting him to apologise for behaving poorly back then kind of like to clear out an old debt before the new year but i dont know if it would be weird given that it s been 1 5 year since he s moved on should i still apologise or would it be too late and therefore inappropriate now p s i also plan to go nc from jan 1st onwards to get over him and move on it s getting too hard to try and be friend friendly when the dynamic seems so much le well dynamic than what it could be i m not sure why on his part i can only guess hurt suspicion of motif respecting his girlfriend and being careful not to give me the wrong idea but i m also too tired of trying to poke around to find out should i apologize now or is it too late,2210,451,0.122,0.153,0.725,0.9576

3480,0,"It's been 7 years since I took an MBTI test in my uni with a result of INTJ. It's not what dictates who I am but the INTJ description mostly fit my personality that led me to know more about myself, strenghts and shortcomings alike.As a young girl, I have been always into toys and interests that are traditionally considered masculine. Cue in toy trucks, robots, computer games (RTS and MOBA were my shit till my early 20s) and outdoor things like biking and flying kites during summer but...Deep inside, I also loved wishing to wear girly clothes and even at once, dress up like a Disney princess. I got presents which are dolls (Barbie and Bratz) which I treasured but I felt too shy in being showy that I liked these feminine stuff because it's uncool plus some young girls are downright bratty and I didn't fit in. The dolls sat in my room, only to play with them on my alone time.When I was a teenager, my interests have shifted and to name a few, I loved reading books that anything I can find in my school library which had a vast collection. I also began to fall in love with manga both for boys and girls but I felt too shy showing my love in girls' manga because I had that embarrassing phase of being not like the other girls. I thought having feminine sides and beinv unapologetic on expressing them was regressive and being weak.Then, I developed crushes on guys but had a hard time in getting my feelings across being a shy teen. I ended up being one of the most socially awkward girls in class. Plus, I developed image issues why other girls look pretty and popular while I just look like a nerdy dork. It's not I'm a loner...I have a small circle of friends in my high school which most of them are still my friends up to this day. You know, even opening up my feelings whenever my girl and gay friends talked were such a huge struggle...Then my university days started and it's also funny that I took an engineering major which is usually and still was a male dominated major when I was in college. My major also made me even more shy to express my femininity as I would stand out and was honestly on not being taken seriously with the guys around me at uni. And being around my university days having known my INTJ result on my MBTI, I was also convoluted that I still have my hidden feminine and really emotional, even hopeless romantic side is almost never mentioned in INTJs.  It's like sure, I felt like myself but I was still hiding some aspects of myself that I feel embarrased to show, on fear on being seen as weak and helpless.At college, it's also the time where I started dating guys and even engaging in hookups. Whilst I still look dorky, the guys I dated still find me attractive and ngl, it was a huge confidence boost and the validation I got...but still, I felt lacking because I haven't fully expressed who I am...Then I graduated from uni and went into grad school + my jobs because, I wanna earn and enrich my career prospects (oh boy I was that idealistic and driven back then, now I tread my life choices more carefully). Since I noticed that in the grand scheme of things, people can comment and say shit but at the end of the day, our own happiness is what matters most, ofc not hurting anyone.So having a job and I finally have more money I can afford, I got into the rabbit hole in expressing my femininity more like being into fashion and makeup.That really helped me glow up that usually I'm considered cute or pretty. Ofc, I make it suit my personality and my lifestyle and that, I rarely chase trends. I also picked interests in traditionally feminine activitites like cooking, nail art and sewing which even helped me further personalize my love for cosplay.Also, I tried to explore and develop my emotional side especially with my romantic relationships and even causal relationships. It easn't easy and even up to this day, now as a married woman, I'm still growing and developing to be a better woman, in looks and emotional maturity and aspirations...and not be a toxic partner to my husband.Ngl, now I feel really free and secure that I finally expressed what I like and who I really am. Ofc, many of my traditionally masculine interests still stay with me and having a job as a software engineer, it doesn't hurt and it's not a disadvantage that I express my femininity. Actually,  it's a strength...and to myself...it makes me more...me.Sorry if it's a wall of text but I just felt sharing my self actualizations as a growing and maturing 27yo INTJ woman.",A 27yo Female INTJ's thoughts oon embracing femininity,it s been 7 year since i took an test in my uni with a result of it s not what dictate who i am but the description mostly fit my personality that led me to know more about myself strenghts and shortcoming alike a a young girl i have been always into toy and interest that are traditionally considered masculine cue in toy truck robot computer game rts and moba were my shit till my early 20 and outdoor thing like biking and flying kite during summer but deep inside i also loved wishing to wear girly clothes and even at once dress up like a disney princess i got present which are doll barbie and bratz which i treasured but i felt too shy in being showy that i liked these feminine stuff because it s uncool plus some young girl are downright bratty and i didn t fit in the doll sat in my room only to play with them on my alone time when i wa a teenager my interest have shifted and to name a few i loved reading book that anything i can find in my school library which had a vast collection i also began to fall in love with manga both for boy and girl but i felt too shy showing my love in girl manga because i had that embarrassing phase of being not like the other girl i thought having feminine side and beinv unapologetic on expressing them wa regressive and being weak then i developed crush on guy but had a hard time in getting my s across being a shy teen i ended up being one of the most socially awkward girl in class plus i developed image issue why other girl look pretty and popular while i just look like a nerdy dork it s not i m a loner i have a small circle of friend in my high school which most of them are still my friend up to this day you know even opening up my s whenever my girl and gay friend talked were such a huge struggle then my university day started and it s also funny that i took an engineering major which is usually and still wa a male dominated major when i wa in college my major also made me even more shy to express my femininity a i would stand out and wa honestly on not being taken seriously with the guy around me at uni and being around my university day having known my result on my i wa also convoluted that i still have my hidden feminine and really emotional even hopeless romantic side is almost never mentioned in s it s like sure i felt like myself but i wa still hiding some aspect of myself that i feel embarrased to show on fear on being seen a weak and helpless at college it s also the time where i started dating guy and even engaging in hookup whilst i still look dorky the guy i dated still find me attractive and ngl it wa a huge confidence boost and the validation i got but still i felt lacking because i haven t fully expressed who i am then i graduated from uni and went into grad school my job because i wanna earn and enrich my career prospect oh boy i wa that idealistic and driven back then now i tread my life choice more carefully since i noticed that in the grand scheme of thing people can comment and say shit but at the end of the day our own happiness is what matter most ofc not hurting anyone so having a job and i finally have more money i can afford i got into the rabbit hole in expressing my femininity more like being into fashion and makeup that really helped me glow up that usually i m considered cute or pretty ofc i make it suit my personality and my lifestyle and that i rarely chase trend i also picked interest in traditionally feminine activitites like cooking nail art and sewing which even helped me further personalize my love for cosplay also i tried to explore and develop my emotional side especially with my romantic relationship and even causal relationship it easn t easy and even up to this day now a a married woman i m still growing and developing to be a better woman in look and emotional maturity and aspiration and not be a toxic partner to my husband ngl now i feel really free and secure that i finally expressed what i like and who i really am ofc many of my traditionally masculine interest still stay with me and having a job a a software engineer it doesn t hurt and it s not a disadvantage that i express my femininity actually it s a strength and to myself it make me more me sorry if it s a wall of text but i just felt sharing my self actualization a a growing and maturing 27yo woman a 27yo female s thought oon embracing femininity,4359,859,0.072,0.206,0.722,0.9993

After reading the traits, characteristics and strengths/weaknesses I felt overwhelmed because I suddenly remembered my childhood. I was basically the kid that sat at the corner of the classroom and spent a lot of time making and designing paper airplanes. I never talked to anyone not because I didn‚Äôt want but because I was socially awkward. I still remember other kids calling me a phenomenon and teachers not appreciating me.I remember that my favorite thing to do was to align my toys and to watch Star Wars... but I didnt have anyone else to share my likings. I feel bad because now that I‚Äôm at college I feel that I haven‚Äôt changed and I just want to let people go because I think it is better for me not to interact with others. The issue here is that when I was in high school I was diagnosed with asperger‚Äôs. That was the first punch and I didn‚Äôt want to accept some things (education here in Mexico is pretty ugly so that doesn‚Äôt help).

3510,0,"Im sure a fair number of us were in the gifted programs at school, or got good grades, or at the very least are confident in the amount of competence we posess.Lately, and I'm sure this is in no small part thanks to the new exposure college has brought me, I've been doubting not only my competency but my intelligence when compared to my friends and peers. On principle, I try to surround myself with people I can learn from. In highschool I had my circles, where certain friends would be specialized in certain areas and bad in others just like me, and in college I'm finding that many people, while remaining specialized, have less bad areas. This results in my feeling of incompetency.In one sense, I like this competition. There are some areas I clearly specialize in more heavily than my college friends, but it's not by such a dominating margin as it was with my highschool buddies. This is good, I think, for improvement and development. If this is not a feeling others have experienced yet, I will give my paltry advice. Feeling incompetent will give you a few options, and but you'll feel the pull towards two options in particular; competition/improvement and self-pity. The problem with competition is it clearly outlines what Jordan Peterson calls the criteria of failure. If you can surpass the goal you are competeing for, you win, if not, you lose and fail. Failure can lead to self-pity. Improvement is a bit more loose. You never quite fail unless you remain stagnant. This is why it may be mosts preferred option, over competition.Self-pity as it pertains to this discussion is likely linked to pride most INTJs find themselves struggling with throughout life. Because we are not as good as the person we compare ourselves to, we feel inadequate. Our pride will have painted a false picture of ourself, a picture that melts when faced with reality.Comparing yourself to others is not usually a good idea, but I feel most do it sub-conciously. Thats why you have to be careful. Where a lot of INTJs can improve, and where I've been working on improving for a long time, is that problem of pride. I would argue that pride is good because of what it does for confidence, but that's just the problem. Pride+Confidence=Arrogance. When the INTJ can improve is finding confidence itself in their ability, not taking pride in the ability and letting that pride breed confidence. In self-reflection, perhaps I placed pride on my competency and not confidence.",Competency and Comparison,im sure a fair number of u were in the gifted program at school or got good grade or at the very least are confident in the amount of competence we pose lately and i m sure this is in no small part thanks to the new exposure college ha brought me i ve been doubting not only my competency but my intelligence when compared to my friend and peer on principle i try to surround myself with people i can learn from in highschool i had my circle where certain friend would be specialized in certain area and bad in others just like me and in college i m finding that many people while remaining specialized have le bad area this result in my of incompetency in one sense i like this competition there are some area i clearly specialize in more heavily than my college friend but it s not by such a dominating margin a it wa with my highschool buddy this is good i think for improvement and development if this is not a others have experienced yet i will give my paltry advice incompetent will give you a few option and but you ll feel the pull towards two option in particular competition improvement and self pity the problem with competition is it clearly outline what jordan peterson call the criterion of failure if you can surpass the goal you are competeing for you win if not you lose and fail failure can lead to self pity improvement is a bit more loose you never quite fail unless you remain stagnant this is why it may be mosts preferred option over competition self pity a it pertains to this discussion is likely linked to pride most s find themselves struggling with throughout life because we are not a good a the person we compare ourselves to we feel inadequate our pride will have painted a false picture of ourself a picture that melt when faced with reality comparing yourself to others is not usually a good idea but i feel most do it sub conciously thats why you have to be careful where a lot of s can improve and where i ve been working on improving for a long time is that problem of pride i would argue that pride is good because of what it doe for confidence but that s just the problem pride confidence arrogance when the can improve is finding confidence itself in their ability not taking pride in the ability and letting that pride breed confidence in self reflection perhaps i placed pride on my competency and not confidence competency and comparison,2379,443,0.139,0.234,0.627,0.9949

3519,0,"Since last year November I have been working as a business consultant at an advisory agency. This week after the end of the year review assessment I received a letter with my salary increase. It was just so sad, a 3,7% increase. I should be happy with it considering covid-19. But as a company we actually have been doing better compared to last year. Including the fact, I got high appraisals from client, made more revenue then expected and overall I performed better then expected. The only thing what stopped them for giving me a job promotion is that I should do more stuff internally for the company. That is also where I'm stuck at... corporate culture.Before this I was a test consultant at another company but I left since sales had trouble with giving consistent assignments/projects at clients. However, I loved the atmosphere over there. So relaxed, kind of nerdlike people, not caring what other people think, lots of flexibility and freedom. The bosses and managers would also regularly chitchat with you. The layout of the company structure is the Spotify model. But I left since I wanted to be challenged more.At my current company from day 1, during the application interviews I already got a bad vibe from the office. It was just so different, but the bad vibe I ignored. And said to myself they are way more professional, everybody dressed in suits, a very business-like atmosphere. And they are more professional, better PR and marketing, better defined processes from top to bottom, the better looking women are also a plus. So I got the job they were very happy with me since they wanted more technical analytical focused employees and not an extra business administration graduate. But it all went downhill during my first assignment. I did not know then that my manager at the company (not at the client) was a micromanager. And I did not know then that as an INTJ - HSP you detest that kind of manager style, since I never experienced that before. He wanted to know and see everything I did at the client, the emails I send,  the quality of the work I wanted to deliver. It took less then two months to have experienced a breakdown and wanting to leave the company. In the end the assignment would only take 3 months to finish. But since I did not perform as the manager would hope he wanted to know everything I did the next month before my next assignment. Luckily he quit that month. I got a new manager who actually understood me since he had two HSP children. I thrived in the next assignment. Team manager at the client said it was the best team he has ever been in. Largely due to me being injected to the project and we did some catching up in the program since they were a few months behind schedule.  Now I lead a team of Indian developers and I'm the contact person for many third parties. This bounce from weak performance to outstanding performance, got me a salary increase of 3,7%. Whoohoo...So that salary increase triggered some thinking. I do not like the corporate culture at my current company. I got a new manager, third one this year. A very career driven woman, end thirties, single, no children. Does a lot of overtime in the evening. Since the company wants the manager to be on an assignment, and only has 4 hours in the week for managerial duties. You can see it takes a toll on her. I got plenty of messages from recruiters, about if I'm thinking about a company switch, my old company wants me back as well. But I also started with a course in becoming a software developer. So the way I see it I have a few options:1. Stay at my current company, which I don't want to stay at for much longer. Wait till I get the promotion to senior position (looks better on resume) And in my free time focus on my software development skills. Then in the future apply at a company for a software development role. 2. Apply at another company, with great work culture and challenges and not deviate from the wanted salary in the negations.

I had to spend 3 days straight with my family members and my only friend since he had to spend the holidays with us due to covid. The whole time it was basically people around me arguing over topics that came up. They get pretty emotional and defensive over arguments, so it just made things pretty draining and edgy around the house. I like to just keep to myself during these arguments since I dont really see the point in winning or losing arguments in a small family dinner.. but somehow they all seem passionate about it to unhealthy degrees.It's also hard since I feel like I'm walking on eggshells all the time, since I'm the one that doesnt like to argue they tend to ""take sides"" against me, so everytime I try to make a joke is taken seriously and I'm seen as being rude. I think all of this happens because I confronted some family members about things of the past a few years ago, needless to say it all went wrong haha. I also only got 2 days of vacation for myself after uni ended for the holidays before the family gatherings started. Thankfully I've been by myself for two days now until new years come. I was also pretty tired since I had to be around a lot of people during the semester.Despite all this I found a career that I really enjoy :) and I got good grades for the first time in years. But I find the social aspect really difficult. I think it's also because I grew up in a place where socializing is seen as crucial (well I guess it is) and people like to make a joke out of everything. I tried to do as others did for a long time since people get it inside your head from a young age that that is the only way to go.

3550,0,"(I'm not sure if I'm in the right place. Feel free to shoo me away if necessary. ;w;)So this INTJ is a classmate of mine. He's not a close friend. I don't even know if we classify as ""friends"". For some reason, though, I seem to see him around often (to be fair, I do encounter his friends quite often, too) and I do feel comfortable around him.He can get quite talkative and lively around his friends, but they say he's very introverted‚Äîone of them even said he's the most introverted person they know. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to inquire of how they were able to say so.I pretty much just started thinking about this since we started talking quite often lately.  By often, I don't mean as often as daily, but we very rarely talked before‚Äîat least not the kind where we start off talking about academics and we'd end up talking about a multitude of topics for well over an hour. I sort of cut our conversation when I feel like it's gotten too long because... eh, I don't want to start ""feeling"" something I don't want to feel, and even if that were to happen, I wouldn't want to give myself away (still, I'd rather not feel).At some point, in one of our conversations, we ended up with telling each other our ""good points/traits/characteristics"" or ""talents"", if you may. I feel bad that I was only able to list very few for him‚Äîhalf-jokingly, even. My bad that I'm not really observant of my sorroundings‚Äîmuch less of people. He, on the other hand, told me that I was overflowing with such things. He then enumerated a lot (around ten, I think), some of which were similar to what I also told him, and some of which I either don't see, or don't appreciate about myself. In the end, he even added, ""and the list goes on"". Aww, I felt so appreciated‚Äîespecially because he listed ""intelligent"" first and that's huge coming from an INTJ.There were also a few times when he mentioned information about me which I either already forgot (I can be forgetful, anyway), consider very insignificant, or haven't told even my closest friends. He typically would mention them totally out of the blue. I'm not creeped out but I'm curious of how he knew of those, and if he just really has that good of a memory (if he just found those out by accident and it's normal for him to remember facts about people).Lastly (please pardon the wall of text), there was this one time when I was bragging with my friends about handsome guys that I know of and am acquainted with. I didn't know he was seated right in front of me (though he was wearing earphones, anyway). When our conversation ended, for some unknown reason, I found him looking at me with a poker face. I just gave him a smile and looked away.That's pretty much all. Honestly, I always had this lingering feeling that he had been observing me, but I also always chose not to think anything of it because he never really seemed to treat me any different from others and we've known each other for over two years. Perhaps I'm also just imagining things.Of course, I might have missed some other details and my perception might be biased, so feel free to try considering factors beyond what I've mentioned.Your thoughts will be very much appreciated.

He does directly ask her if she is alright, and even though she begins to dramatically list off reasons as to why she is not, he still patiently/carefully listens without speaking, and learns that she is not returning home due to tensions with her parents, and that her younger sister has run away. Although her situation is ""heavy"" so to speak, he still urgently wants for her to feel better, as he understands that what she is going through must undoubtedly be difficult, and was depressed for a few years himself - although he is a bit hesitant to do so, he offers to let her stay with him, as he truly does want her to feel better/have a place to live in and thinks that he can help her mend her relationship with her parents and younger sister, or at least assist in the process. He buys her coffee as well even without her asking (though he does check to see what she likes,) and follows through on his offer to let this stranger stay with him after hearing about her situation (i.e. she does end up actually staying with him, which is a bit uncomfortable for him as he is introverted, but he figures that he himself will get used to it and wants her to feel comfortable in the meantime.)

HAHAHA. while he is very supportive and kind and just an overall great person (our core values align p well), he also has this strange insecure streak (it‚Äôs more internal, like he‚Äôs insecure about his strengths/capability, not so much unhealthy-insecure). though he actively works on fighting that, which i admire a lot, it kinda is a turnoff for me..........because i could be supportive and very loving, but i ain‚Äôt about fixing other people. otherwise, he is actually very attractive to me. his value system, principles, faith (as in religion), even sense of humour - all totally up my alley. it‚Äôs just this... lack of intellectual/conversational stimulation, and the worry about his insecurity that‚Äôs holding me back. i‚Äôm in a dilemma, bc on one hand i need to feel things out more before i actually can decide, but on the other i really do NOT want to prematurely lead him on. so....... any thoughts on my situation would be much appreciated. thanks!!

3571,0,"&amp;#x200B;I would like some insights. I'm (INFJ. 26f) in a relationship with an INTJ (26m). We've been dating for 4 months and became an official couple a month ago, today would have been our first month lol. Anyway. It's been complicated because he's kinda strange in my point of view. We meet on a dating app and we started hanging out a lot together. 3 or 4 times a week, since we live pretty close to each other and we have a ton of free time. When we weren't together we were playing videogames online, he soon meet my parents and introduced me to his friends as his girl. But he constantly reminded me we weren't a couple. He said something very douchy about him being the one ""in charge"" while deciding when we were gonna become a couple, he said ""you would be my gf right now if I wanted"". Which drove me crazy thinking he felt like he was the only one with the power to decide the relationship we had; also he implied he didn't want me to be his gf. We had a fight. He said something extremely rough: ""I like you but I don't like you enough. I wanna make sure I like you enough in the things I care about before becoming a couple""... I mean that's absolutely reasonable, but the way he said it. Absolutely ignoring what I want made me angry and when I tried to explain it to him he didn't understand.For some reason, we kept talking and hanging out. He's fun to be around. So fast forward, our second fight was at the second month. He broke my laptop, he was gonna fix it but he got ""busy with other things"". Then he became super avoidant and started ignoring me and being mean to the point I cried. I ended up repairing it myself which was very expensive (I also got a bit scammed). Anyway, my mom (who is ENTJ and has high intuition) gave me the insight that he might be ignoring me and playing with my feelings because he didn't want to pay for the repair. We made up... again. Fast forward, third month of dating. He officially asked me to be his girlfriend, he brought some chocolates to celebrate. Three days later it was his birthday, we spend his day together and the next day I bought him a graphic card and organized him a birthday party. He was so moved he wanted to cry. It was the first time since he was a kid that he had a birthday party. At first he refused to go until I ""pushed him"". He said it was the best day of his life, he was so grateful and said he didn't want me to leave him ever. That weekend was the peak of our relationship. We were on nine cloud.We are in the forth month. So according to his behaviour, I can say he goes through periods where he's easily annoyed by anything and needs alone time. But instead of asking for it he becomes abrasive and mean. He became bitter because of christmas. He didn't celebrate it at his home and I celebrated it far from him with my family in another state. My sister came home for Christmas so I've been hanging out with her all these days, she lives far and I don't know when I will see her again. Anyway it's been days since I have payed him any attention. Yesterday I was out shopping and came home late at 9pm and he wanted to play warzone with me. I didn't answer his call and he got very angry. So I started asking him why he has been acting so mean in the last few days. He said he was angry at everyone and that I should get used to it or leave. Then he kept saying some self-loathing comments about not wanting to have a family or being on a relationship. That hurt me a lot. All his behaviour hurt me. I asked him if he wanted me to leave him alone and he replied that he doesn't know since he feels like a part of him would regret it. We kept talking. He said some things about his ex gfs and how they were way less sensitive than me. I asked him if he didn't like that about me, he answered ""I didn't say that"". Anyway the more the conversation advanced the more offended I felt. I ended up asking him if he wanted time since he doesn't seem sure about our relationship. He said he would think about it. Which drove me crazy and I answered ""don't think about it. We are having a break""  I feel confused if I did right. He's fun to hang around, we became good friends and he says he adores me but it's hard for me to notice that since his actions don't match his words. Or maybe I'm too sensitive to his roughness. He's nice to me but it's very evident that I'm the one that puts more effort. It hurts me when people say that, even his family and friends think I'm too giving when he doesn't give much in return. I try to not talk about him with my family and friends since I'm gonna be criticized. My friends don't even facebook-like the pictures where I'm with him since they don't like him. I feel like I'm doing something wrong.  He says he adores me and loves me and I'm the best girl he has met in his life but I feel like he's not really committing to the relationship. He didn't even fight the breakup, he just accepted it. He probably was so alleviated of getting rid of me.   Being in this relationship it's like a labyrinth. Whenever I'm finally reaching the goal and having the nice yummy prize (which to me is a happy and stable relationship), but I reach a dead-end once again (he pushes me away and treats me like a stranger). I don't know how to communicate that to my INTJ much less now that we have broken up.   Tl;dr. I broke up with my INTJ after 4 months of dating because I felt like he wasn't into the relationship as much as me.   Any advice, comment, the experience is welcomed. I'm trying to make up my mind about this situation and learn the most I can from it.

3572,0," Met a guy (INTJ) online two months ago, who lives 1 hour away from my city. He was busy with exams, so we couldn't meet up for two months. Consequently, this led to a lot of pre-meeting phone calling, messaging, anticipation, and optimism about each other's intellect, values, emotional maturity, and mental chemistry with each other. We finally met up. Anticipations were verbally confirmed and the physical chemistry was insane on top of that. Before he left, we briefly communicated that we were interested in seeing where this goes and that I would meet him soon in his student town once the winter vacation ends.  After our 24+ hour meeting, he left for his family home town for winter vacation, which is much further away from my city. We texted back and forth for about 3 days but messages got a bit shorter than usual from his side. At the time, I attributed it to depleted testosterone and the fact that he was with family so thought nothing of it. Then silence from him for two days, which in normal dating standards is fine...but since we had a 2 month courtship period of messaging and calling from which he was now being inconsistent, I figured he knew I'd be confused and check-in? After the two days passed I messaged him saying ""Hey! I was expecting to hear from you? Have you been busy?"" He then replied in the longest and most vulnerable message he has ever sent to me that he was having a serious family crisis (regarding the dementia of his grandmother and the waning health of his mother in taking care of her etc. I won't go further than that.). Naturally, I gave my condolences and told him to take space if he needed it. To which he replied, ""Thanks, I hope you take care too.""  I didn't really know what to respond to this. So I just took it as him taking space and not talking to me indefinitely. I didn't hear from him for over a week. So just in order to reconfigure and clarify, I sent a message saying that I hope he was well, telling him I'm open to seeing where things go with him cause we have a good connection, etc. That I see that he withdrew, which is totally okay. But that I needed to just get an idea where we stood. Since he didn't really clarify.  He then typed up a huge essay of a text explaining, in detail, what the new family developments were and his difficulty with it, etc. Followed by an ""I don't think I'm in a good situation to date with you. I think I need to take care of things here.""  I then replied again with condolences and worry about him, said that I understood and that I guess the timing wasn't right. I kept it brief and kind because of the conflict of needing to console him but of also keeping my boundaries (on the very odd chance that part of it might be loss of interest and him up-playing the situation).  I thought he wouldn't reply. But then he bombarded me with many messages thanking me for my concern etc. and saying he's sorry it couldn't work out etc. etc.  I asked one close friend about her interpretation of the situation and she dismissed it as an elaborate ""hit it and quit it"" slow fade situation. She argues that although the family situation is a thing, he would have still messaged here and there if he were truly interested. But I hardly think that is the case? Especially if he is an INTJ? I see it more as: yeah there wasn't like huge interest in a serious relationship yet, we were in the get to know each other stage. So if a family crisis happens, surely that would squash that level of interest.  I know that INTJs are known for moving on, forgetting, and not looking back. But considering these special circumstances, I can't help but wonder whether we could pick up where we left off at some point? How are INTJs normally inclined to see these things? Heck, I'm even tempted to start a friendship with him, as I a) am genuinely concerned about his family situation (but don't know what the boundaries are ) and b) genuinely enjoy the intellectual connection we shared. I just don't know. Should I reach out to him again in a month to check-in?  It's a confusing situation, seeing as we technically only met once but had been getting to know each other for two months before. I really like him. Not only as a romantic connection but also as a person.  I'm an INTP by the way.",Unfinished Business with INTJ,met a guy online two month ago who life 1 hour away from my city he wa busy with exam so we couldn t meet up for two month consequently this led to a lot of pre meeting phone calling messaging anticipation and optimism about each other s intellect value emotional maturity and mental chemistry with each other we finally met up anticipation were verbally confirmed and the physical chemistry wa insane on top of that before he left we briefly communicated that we were interested in seeing where this go and that i would meet him soon in his student town once the winter vacation end after our 24 hour meeting he left for his family home town for winter vacation which is much further away from my city we texted back and forth for about 3 day but message got a bit shorter than usual from his side at the time i attributed it to depleted testosterone and the fact that he wa with family so thought nothing of it then silence from him for two day which in normal dating standard is fine but since we had a 2 month courtship period of messaging and calling from which he wa now being inconsistent i figured he knew i d be confused and check in after the two day passed i messaged him saying hey i wa expecting to hear from you have you been busy he then replied in the longest and most vulnerable message he ha ever sent to me that he wa having a serious family crisis regarding the dementia of his grandmother and the waning health of his mother in taking care of her etc i won t go further than that naturally i gave my condolence and told him to take space if he needed it to which he replied thanks i hope you take care too i didn t really know what to respond to this so i just took it a him taking space and not talking to me indefinitely i didn t hear from him for over a week so just in order to reconfigure and clarify i sent a message saying that i hope he wa well telling him i m open to seeing where thing go with him cause we have a good connection etc that i see that he withdrew which is totally okay but that i needed to just get an idea where we stood since he didn t really clarify he then typed up a huge essay of a text explaining in detail what the new family development were and his difficulty with it etc followed by an i don t think i m in a good situation to date with you i think i need to take care of thing here i then replied again with condolence and worry about him said that i understood and that i guess the timing wasn t right i kept it brief and kind because of the conflict of needing to console him but of also keeping my boundary on the very odd chance that part of it might be loss of interest and him up playing the situation i thought he wouldn t reply but then he bombarded me with many message thanking me for my concern etc and saying he s sorry it couldn t work out etc etc i asked one close friend about her interpretation of the situation and she dismissed it a an elaborate hit it and quit it slow fade situation she argues that although the family situation is a thing he would have still messaged here and there if he were truly interested but i hardly think that is the case especially if he is an i see it more a yeah there wasn t like huge interest in a serious relationship yet we were in the get to know each other stage so if a family crisis happens surely that would squash that level of interest i know that s are known for moving on forgetting and not looking back but considering these special circumstance i can t help but wonder whether we could pick up where we left off at some point how are s normally inclined to see these thing heck i m even tempted to start a friendship with him a i a am genuinely concerned about his family situation but don t know what the boundary are and b genuinely enjoy the intellectual connection we shared i just don t know should i reach out to him again in a month to check in it s a confusing situation seeing a we technically only met once but had been getting to know each other for two month before i really like him not only a a romantic connection but also a a person i m an intp by the way unfinished business with,4118,817,0.048,0.15,0.802,0.9984

He genuinely cares about his wife and supporting her, as he sees her hard work and partly works so hard in regards to his own job to lend her a helping hand, and to ensure that he is a good role model for his own children.) He always likes to ensure that he knows at least a bit about a product before he tries selling it to be safe/avoid feeling anxious, though he has been able to sell products in the past even when he did not know a great deal about the product due to his aforementioned charisma (he can honestly be a \*bit\* manipulative when selling products, but not in a malicious way in the slightest...)His social skills help him out a great amount in regards to his job as a salesman; he has always been popular amongst groups of people, even going back as far as elementary school - he aimed to be popular in elementary school as he felt in his household that since he was the middle child, his spotlight was stolen by his older brother, or his younger sister. He aimed to be known for being ""cool"" and him being so personable led to him being voted in class president against the richest girl in school. He did enjoy hearing gossip (and still does, honestly,) but does not necessarily partake in it (i.e. he does not really speak negatively about other people unless he dislikes someone - and he is honest about it when he dislikes people, though not too blunt - but he does enjoy hearing about the business of others from friends.) Although he has never been what some would consider to be dumb, he maintained average grades whilst in elementary and middle school due to not having a serious interest in the subject matter - however, since he ended up dating (and later on marrying,) the smartest girl in his grade (he was interested in her due to her being pretty, kind, and finding her intelligence attractive... he liked that she was always helping he and other people out, yet also capable of solving nearly any problem,) he asked her in high school to help him raise his grades, as he understood that he needed to start maintaining higher grades in order to start seriously looking at a career (he also saw his girlfriend succeeding academically and wondered, on some level, why he deserved her. He wanted to be the guy that she deserved to have, or at least this was how he thought of it, and also wanted to help himself out career-wise.)He actually committed to raising his grades with her help, even though it was difficult at first to maintain a consistent studying routine as he always wanted to sit down and relax after school, or head out with some friends. He had always maintained a healthy romantic relationship with her even whilst dating due to being willing to talk out different issues with her (she had to start the conversation, but he was open to it and willing to listen, as he really did want to make things work.) He did end up attending a good school in regards to college due to his dedication, and even though he did care for her, he and his aforementioned girlfriend agreed to break off their relationship for a little while due to attending different schools (he was upset about this, but tried dating two other people in college, as did she... only to find that it didn't ""feel the same"" and that he missed her too much. She would later on report feeling the same.) After graduating, he re-connected with his former girlfriend due to understanding based upon his other two relationship experiences that she was his best match (and hoping that she still felt the same - she did!)He found his first sales job through a social connection (through a buddy of his,) as he ensured that he networked throughout college (partly due to his aspirations, and this was partly natural - he is the kind of person who would have made connections no matter what school he went to,) and although he did have some fun as he learned more about the sales world, he still made sure to take his job seriously, as he knew that he wanted a future with his girlfriend and financial stability. He moved up in the ranks due to his social skills and interest in improving at the job, and married his girlfriend - he, of course, begun to work harder and harder after their kids were born. However, he recalled his own father having been a workaholic, and feeling that he didn't get to know him as well as he could have due to this (and feeling that his father was boring and only ever rambled about money); for this reason, although he makes sure that he establishes boundaries with his kids (he, along with his wife, encourages them to maintain at least average grades in school and undoubtedly parents them,) he still successfully gets to know his children as people and pays attention to them. He has a genuine relationship with each of his children, and even though he can be direct with them at times, is loved by them - he is usually understanding of their feelings, yet does not tolerate disrespect from them toward he or his wife and is clear about this.[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kl0n4t)",What would you assume?,this guy is a successful salesman he is successful in part

No date per say (too serious and covid restrictions), just a casual meet up 2 hours before class. He gladly accepted and seemed on another planet the rest of the afternoon, it was adorable.Unfortunately on said day, our game and my plan to confess were ruined because his buddy came and sat with us after barely 30min. It was apparently an habit of them to come earlier to study. I was annoyed. I don't understand why the INTJ didn't asked his friend to come later or to leave us (2p game, didn't know how to play).I've asked for a rematch twice since but received no conclusive answer. Yet he isn't too shy around me anymore, he's been giving me encouraging signals and we've been texting a little. So once again I don't understand.

3620,0,"There is a tendency that almost every time I meet someone who ends up being a friend, surprises me in a bad way, and there's a tendency that they end up being a perceiving type. For example, my ENFP roommate randomly threw a huge party with random people smoking and drinking in our apartment without telling me or planning it and I get really mad about it because it was very spontaneous and unexpected of him to do that when I just wanted to go home and relax. One time he even came into my room when I was trying to sleep because I had school the next day and was trying to stay on my schedule and at like 3 AM brought some random dude into my room and jumped on my bed and then turned on the lights and just started laughing, I was pissed off when this happened because again I did not ever expect him to do something like that.  My other friend, an ENTP, and I make plans, and a lot of times we have solid plans made, he completely forgets or just says ""oh, something more interesting came up and I just spontaneously went with that instead"" which surprised me since he told me we would be doing something but ended up just lying to my face which I did not expect. My own mom is an ESTP, and she also does things that I never expected her to do, for example, throwing out my things without asking me first if I needed them, or whipping me with a towel out of the blue just because to her it's fun. Another example of this is that I was trying to start a project with an INTP and ENFP, we all met up and talked about this business idea and I thought since we traveled just to get together to discuss it that we were serious about actually doing it but it turns out they just flaked and changed their mind about things and got caught up with other more interesting things which again I did not expect. Does anybody else have experiences like this with perceiving types where they just do things that you would never expect them to do only to be disappointed and learn more about who they are?

3636,0,"I don't know, from my understanding of our personality type, we like being strong on our own and doing things that make us feel safe and secure.  Maybe that's a universal human pursuit, though.I had been thinking about this for a long time.  I am 26, have had a facebook and various other social media accounts since I was about 16, later than my peers I remember.  Expression on these platforms was something I became used to, though social media now is so much bigger than it was 10 years ago!  I struggled with over sharing.  I was in a situation where I didn't have close friends from age 13 (6th grade) onward.  I went through a lot of difficult times, and felt a lot of loneliness that was painful.  I would post personal things on facebook (mostly) to a wide array of people.  People would help, but then I'd feel bad because everyone knew my business.  I just wanted people to know I was still here.  But ultimately it wasn't good for my relationships and others' perception of me.What I learned:  If you are someone who doesn't talk too much and isn't too expressive, and if people don't know what you struggle with, they will ""fill in the blanks"" of your personality with positives, most usually.  They will subconsciously give you the benefit of the doubt.I was going through a lot and needed help.  This last year has shown me how few people I can actually count on for anything, so I decided it was time to thin the herd on social medias.  I went from about 500 facebook friends, to 37.

I took it as a negative. She never had GREAT social skills so it didn't help. But it was mainly me not accepting her, not her fault.I resented that emotional coldness during those social situations, probably because I was ignorant of her personality and didn't accept it.

3641,0,"I've been interested in MBTI for several years now, I've done lots research since then, and I'm finally at the point where I'm at least 99% sure I'm an INTJ. I've done every well-known cognitive function test you can name, asked for outside input from other people in the MBTI community... you get the point.However I noticed I have one very uncommon trait for INTJs that I haven't seen in any other INTJ I've met both online and irl. I enjoy my solitude, I get worn out from work, I'm notoriously bad at talking to people I don't know very well, and I always feel like I need a week to myself after an exhausting day out. However, when I'm with my closest friends and family, I can become h y p e r.  REALLY hyper. When you put me in any setting with the people I'm closest to, my energy alone could match that of a college frat party (obvious exaggeration but I really need a metaphor to imply just how energetic I get). Sometimes these bursts of energy last for only the amount of time that I spend with them, but sometimes this energy can last for days. For example, if I spend a weekend with my friends, I might sometimes feel really antsy the next day, wishing I could go out again. I'm agitated, restless, and it's usually hard for me to focus, sit still, and be productive on these days. This is one of the traits that led me to believe that I was an ISTP for about a year.

3642,0,"For some reason everybody wants to be an INTJ. I‚Äôm not really sure why because I don‚Äôt believe any personality type to be better or worse than the others but people have made being INTJ a trend like it‚Äôs some kind of beauty standard for the MBTI. Here is what I mean when I say that being INTJ is the ‚Äúbeauty standard‚Äù of the MBTI world: People who are not INTJ force themselves to believe that they are, and people who are INTJ feel the need to embody and/or exaggerate every single trait provided by less than accurate sources. The most prevalent issue to me is that they perpetuate the narrative that INTJs are unfeeling robots when this is not the case. Personality types do not determine your emotions or lack thereof. If you can‚Äôt experience an emotion, then you most likely have a personality disorder (which I would like to state that there is nothing wrong with as these cannot be helped.) MBTI is used in part to explain how we are likely to experience emotions and in turn, how we may handle them or express them, not if we feel emotions at all. Some people here think that certain emotions or mental illnesses are caused by being an INTJ and then there are people who complain about people expressing their emotions and experiences with mental illness because they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs INTJ enough. I agree that there should be a separate sub for INTJs looking for advice because in all honesty this sub has become more of a therapy sub than a discussion sub- but who the hell are some of you to tell people who they are based on a few posts they have made? To both of these groups I need you to understand this: correlation does not equal causation. Being INTJ does not cause you to experience these things or not experience these things. How can a group of people who claim to be INTJ be so closed minded?¬†¬†People on here are trying too hard to fit the INTJ stereotype. I am a firm believer in the MBTI system, but I do not believe that every single person within a specific personality type is going to embody every single trait given. Personality is more dynamic than 4 letters given to you by a test. While the test may be accurate, people do themselves a disservice by underestimating the complexity of personality and the human psyche.¬†¬†Instead of molding yourself to fit the results of a personality test, let the results fit into the mold of who you are. It‚Äôs okay to not check every single box because if you make yourself check every box, then you will embody the results instead of letting the results embody you. Think for yourselves and stop trying to be the heartless, pompous, arrogant know-it-alls that the unreliable sources make us out to be. I don‚Äôt understand why anybody would WANT to be any of those things. And stop using being INTJ as an excuse to be an asshole. Your MBTI doesn‚Äôt determine if you‚Äôre an ass, YOU DO. It‚Äôs just shocking to me that as the Architects, so many INTJs on this sub and in general are so willing to follow the herd. Be yourselves.

3645,0," This girl is determined to win a poetry contest after an incident earlier on in class leads her to believe that she may be coming close to being knocked down as her grade's smartest/most high achieving student (in regards to academic performance, or should I say GPA - another student in class had received a grade higher than hers on a spelling quiz.) She has an obsessive need with needing to be the best, in spite of her parents being supportive (though her father does encourage her to receive good marks.) She is unable to think of anything to write in regards to a poem, or at least anything that may lead to her winning, as whilst she is capable of coming up with creative solutions (or just solutions in general) to problems if asked, she has difficulty writing with true emotional depth in the way some can and is aware of this. She is afraid of ""looking dumb"" because that would prove that she is not actually as smart as people think. She is self aware that she's willingly taken the ""smart one"" role amongst her peers and maintaining that role is a lot of pressure... she is naturally shy and passive by nature, and feels that being smart is what makes her stand out as someone special. Because of this, she plagiarizes the poem (this happens before the age of the Internet,) and does end up winning the poetry contest with the plagiarized poem. She initially tries to justify the cheating to herself in order to ease her guilty conscience after winning... but her guilty conscience leads her to imagine the trophy staring her down, and the trophy talking to her every time she looks at it. She is asked by the principal of the school to read her poem, although she initially intends on confessing when he sits her down. Even though she has this opportunity in front of her, she still feels guilty, and imagines the trophy talking to her. She does sit to herself and say, "" You didn't do the hard work you're capable of. You stole a poem and called yourself a poet. You should have searched deep inside yourself like all real poets do."" The guilt is enough to a point in which she is noticeably upset enough for her parents to notice (her father practices fencing with her,) even though she will not give direct reasoning at the time for her displeasure. On the day in which she is supposed to present the poem, she confesses to her parents a bit earlier, and then confesses to the principal with them in front of her right before it is her turn to go up. She admits that being the best is important to her: "" I'm used to being the best, sir. That's who I am."" When the principal asks her if there is more to who she is than being the best, she states, ""I really don't know, sir."" Who would do this?

He hasn't really told me how he feels and if I bring it up or ask him he doesn't really say anything and he gets distance with me. We won't text or hangout for a week or 2. Then when he does come back we're back at this cycle.

3667,0,"Just jumping right into it this has been a huge pain point in my life since like forever. I‚Äôm pretty sure a weaker person would‚Äôve committed suicide but thank God (and i truly mean that) that I‚Äôm an introvert and actually need little to no social interaction. But ever since grade school it seems like people have gone out of their way to conspire against me and make my life miserable.I remember being in highschool, being the shy art kid in the back of the class and having everyone clown on me just for keeping to myself. I was a bit mature for my age to have the forsight to know that they were just being dumb little kids. I never cared for the social hierarchy of High school and thought it was corny af my whole 4 years. After high school i thought that shit was over but almost 6 years later i run into a girl I barely knew in high school (we had PE together i think) and she makes a comment about me being shy as if I‚Äôm still that person.. Keep in mind this girl had like one class with me and i never talked to her.. I barely remember the names of classmates i talked to everyday and this woman is holding some grudge against me because i was shy in high school..With that said, the past few days Ive been having the weirdest interactions with absolute strangers more than usual. It doesnt help that I‚Äôm a black male living in the Deep South with the current political climate either. I try my best not to associate attitudes i get from people with my race but it seems to be the only thing that makes sense.Just today i was running last minute errands with my family, we went to Office Depot to pick up an order. Some huge middle aged dude (white) looked about 40  was just staring at me like he was crazy. I didnt think much of it as I‚Äôm used to this shit by now but my niece noticed and mentioned the dude looked like he wanted to legit kill me. And it wasnt like i did anything I was literally just looking at the laptop display while on the phone.Next stop I‚Äôm at a target, this older couple (white) is behind me and my sister inline I‚Äôm just standing there minding my own business going through instagram.. We leave the store and my sister is talking about how they were staring me down the whole time..Not to mention the fact that the as soon as i got up to the register the cashier (black dude) avoided eye contact with me and didnt speak to me at all.. No greeting or anything.Next stop the grocery store we‚Äôre picking up some last minute ingredients for grandma. I get up to the front of the line, two young girls (black).. Again no greeting or anything... They almost act mad I‚Äôm in their line.. I‚Äôm just trying to get my shit and go.. The girl checking me out passes a look at the girl that‚Äôs bagging. These people ive never met or seen in my life are acting like I just pissed in isle 3 or something.. Stone faced both of them the whole time says nothing to me.. I‚Äôm so used to this shit i dont even care so they get no reaction out of me I literally just think theyre acting super dumb and hateful for no reason. I honestly dont understand why this tends to happen to me. At first i thought it was because I stayed in a small town and possibly there was a rumor going around about me but now I feel like people just hate on me for no reason. I was literally just running errands minding my own business on my phone.I know INTJ‚Äôs get a lot of hate for being closed off but how can complete strangers in public sense this so quickly?

In the past I‚Äôve gotten ISTJ once and INTJ twice. But today I took one and got ENTJ, with extroversion being just slightly higher than introversion. I‚Äôll try to explain my behaviors best I can without typing out an essay.I‚Äôd say i‚Äôm right in the middle of being an introvert and extrovert. While I definitely enjoy some solitude and isolation, too much of it drives me insane. I‚Äôm not a party animal by any means but I enjoy social events occasionally, and this pandemic really sucks as far as lack of social interaction. I exhibit a lot of INTJ thought processes but one huge thing that sets me apart from most is speaking my mind. I don‚Äôt always speak my mind 100% but if someone is talking politics for example and says misleading stuff based on emotions or misinformation and I can get extremely heated. In other words I definitely don‚Äôt sit quietly and pretend to agree with someone unless it‚Äôs a college professor and my grade depends on it. But even then there‚Äôs been a couple instances where I spoke out and I could tell the professor got really mad but didn‚Äôt show it. So it really depends on the situation as far as when I let my views be known. I can literally debate all day if I have to, I thrive on it. When it comes to emotions, I feel like I have too many outbursts to be an INTJ. I can hold them in for a while but if I reach a breaking point I flip out. When it comes to leadership I definitely display strong leadership qualities when given the chance. But it can be super frustrating if I have to lead stupid people who don‚Äôt cooperate and I harp on them until they do their parts because I‚Äôd be damned if I‚Äôm gonna sink down with them.The future, I do a lot of planning for the future and I always think about all the different potential outcomes of scenarios.

I still stand by that, but things did take a turn today. I thought I'd been abundantly clear about my intentions by asking her out on dates, etc., but for the heck of it I decided to be as clear and direct as possible. I hate texting personal stuff, but that's the only form of communication she and I can agree on right now. So this was our text exchange this afternoon...Me: Hey &lt;insert clever name&gt;, I want the getting to know you stage to lead to a relationship. What do you think? 2020 sucked, but slowly getting to know you is pretty great üòäHer: This year is *tough* but that‚Äôs kind of you to say! I have to be honest and tell you I‚Äôm not looking for a relationship but I truly value and appreciate your friendship in such a tumultuous timeI did text back after that to thank her for her honesty and say I'd like to continue being friends, etc. However, I am a bit tender right now. I really didn't love myself completely until this year. I started transitioning a decade ago (female to male), but still had body issues related to weight. My weight even led to me having to cancel bottom surgery a couple years back. I'm not mr. athlete but I'm down from 315 lbs to 190 lbs. I don't think I would have ever approached her in February if I hadn't finally liked who I saw in the mirror. So, I'm tender because I really liked her and being this vulnerable and getting this far is so new to me.But I am so grateful for this experience. She is a wonderful woman and I truly hope she finds happiness in life. I hope we can stay friends. I can make my romantic feelings go away once I know they're unrequited, sure, but I still care for her on a deeper level. I want her in my life, in my future, even if it's not in the way I envisioned before. Her friendship is valuable to me.Thank you to all of you beautiful INTJs for your insights and replies!

3703,0,"You know, as an INTJ, one problem I have with a lot of INTJs is that some of them can be really terrible. Some can be stuck up, snobbish, *always* assume they're right and no one else is, they look down on other people, and they try to use ""logic"" to excuse their horrible behavior. It's also especially terrible when they're like, ""Well, if you like art or wear colors other than black or enjoy physical activities then you're not really an INTJ."" I've got stuff like that before. Like... Seriously. It's almost as if they think the actual cognitive functions have nothing to do with the personality and it's all about the stereotypes. INTJs can like art. INTJs can wear pastels. INTJs can enjoy physical activities. I've done extensive research on the INTJ and the cognitive functions, and there's no doubt that it is my personality type, but I don't really fit the ""mastermind villain"" stereotype. I like art; music, painting, poetry. I wear pastels sometimes, especially during the summer (all black is the worst in the summer where I live, it's so hot).

Ehhh, I get where she's coming from, but I think that's unfair, or she's basing that from outdated information. Sometimes I unintentionally intimidate people with my confidence and willingness to talk about interesting things, but I don't feel it ever exits ""well meaning"" territory or hurts anybody.I would rather have people decide my personality isn't for them, rather than pretend to get along for sake of fitting in a group.But it does suck when people feel, ""You just don't read the room"".I damn well can read the room, it's just, I'm not always going to agree with it.There's a yin-yang to it.

3711,0,"I don‚Äôt want to say it, but I feel like I‚Äôm beginning to feel hopeless in our ability to communicate. It always seems we‚Äôre discussing something completely different. I get the logic vs emotion dynamic, and I try to keep emotions in mind but to avail. Our latest disagreement surrounds a game. Essentially both parties come up with date ideas and put them in a jar. If you draw a date idea, you‚Äôre responsible for organizing it. My wife has been putting chores in the jar (e.g. return amazon packages). I‚Äôve been putting dates (e.g. Go-Karting, fancy restaurants, etc.). Over the weekend, we went on a mini vacation for her birthday and didn‚Äôt complete any ‚Äúdates‚Äù the previous week. This is important to understand her perspective. The thing is, as an INTJ, my mind is always improving things and I wanted to make some suggestions on the game rules: 1. the organizer doesn‚Äôt reveal the date until the day of, 2. the dates have to be on our joint calendar for visibility (the calendar could just show ‚ÄúDate Night‚Äù). She says she doesn‚Äôt like the idea. I ask why (of course I do). She says ‚Äúhow would I know what to wear?‚Äù I say we could put the dress code in the notes...like yelp. She mentions we haven‚Äôt done the ones from the last week.(Granted, I forgot about them with everything going on last week...hence my calendar idea. But it‚Äôs not like she mentioned them either.)Anyway, the convo devolves into her complaining about changing things and me saying we don‚Äôt have to make any more changes. Let‚Äôs leave it as is. This is unacceptable to her and she says we‚Äôre changing it but complains some more.So, in instances like this, I don‚Äôt know what to do. She‚Äôs annoyed and I say we can drop it. She refuses to drop it but still complains.  I insist that bee can drop it if it upsets her. She refuses but continues to complain (like ‚Äúwell, since we‚Äôre always changing things...‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just redo the entire thing since we‚Äôre keep changing things...‚ÄùThis leads to a blow up.

From what I gather, she wanted to do the ‚Äúdates‚Äù from last week, and since we haven‚Äôt done them, then I am dismissing her dates. And my idea for dates to be a surprise ruins her date ideas like doing Amazon returns. And since I really don‚Äôt want to do her chores as dates, then I am effectively dismissing her ideas. So we need to redo everything from the ground up.We haven‚Äôt really spoken since yesterday.

Due to the pandemic, (and a myriad of other factors), I have resorted to online dating. I recognize that as an INTJ, I am inclined to be critical of others and I try to see past this personal bias. Despite my efforts to connect with men my age, I continuously find them to be shallow, unmotivated, uninteresting and most importantly immature. Quite frankly, I am beyond frustrated. If I do happen to begin speaking with someone semi-regularly, I quickly find that they are either unable or unwilling to carry out any form of intellectual conversation (using intellectual for lack of a better word). There is absolutely no seriousness or depth to any conversation I have had. The dichotomy to this is that if I find a man who is more ‚Äúintellectually-inclined‚Äù he tends to be dismissive or me or aggressive in conversation. I am calling out to my fellow INTJs, more specifically female INTJs, for dating advice. How do I find someone which I am compatible with? Where do these rare breeds hide? As a side note, I also date women, but I find that many of them do not like me (minimal matches with women in comparison to men, despite me ‚Äúswiping‚Äù on them somewhat of an equal amount).
